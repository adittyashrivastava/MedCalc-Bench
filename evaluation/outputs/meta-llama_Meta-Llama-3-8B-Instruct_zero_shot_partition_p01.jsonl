Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.", "Question": "Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "LLM Answer": "10.4", "LLM Explanation": "First, we need to find the patient's serum creatinine level from the patient note.

It is mentioned that the patient's creatinine level is 134 \u03bcmol/L.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 70 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 134.0 \u00b5mol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 134.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.015 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.015 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.015 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 134.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL.

Urinalysis indicated proteinuria (0.2 g/day) without hematuria. A head CT revealed maxillary sinusitis. Tissue from a nasal mucosal biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation in the extravascular area. Because of these combined findings, he was diagnosed as having granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for GPA and Watts\u2019 algorithm [, ].

We confirmed alveolar hemorrhage by bronchoscopy.\nThe biopsied brain material from the surgery revealed a granulomatous inflammation with geographic necrosis and multinucleated giant cells in the perivascular area of the thickened dura mater and leptomeninges (fig. ). Small vessels in the meninges were involved in the granulomatous lesions, and the lumens of the veins were often occluded. In the cerebral cortices and the white matter in these areas, hemorrhagic infarction was widely observed. After treatment with prednisolone (20 mg/day) and azathioprine (40 mg/day), the disturbance of consciousness substantially improved (GCS: E4V3M5), and the epistaxis stopped.

Her lab results were notable for elevated white blood cell count (WBC) 25.2 x 103 \u03bcL (3.9-11.3 x 103 \u03bcL), hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL (11.3-15.1 g/dL), platelets 58.0 x 103 \u03bcL (165-366 x 103 \u03bcL), troponin 0.164 ng/mL (<0.010 ng/mL), lactic acid 2.5 mmol/L (0.5-2.0 mmol/L), and a basic chemistry panel was within normal limits. The urinalysis was remarkable for the presence of WBCs, leukocyte esterase, and bacteria with a urine culture pending. Additionally, two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Her electrocardiogram was significant for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate (RVR). She was started on ceftriaxone for probable UTI and was admitted to the hospital for further management. Further diagnostics included lower extremity Doppler ultrasound, which revealed deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A bedside echocardiogram indicated right ventricular strain, and the N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 8,215 pg/mL (<449 pg/mL). Due to concern for possible pulmonary embolism in the setting of known DVT, the patient was started on a continuous heparin infusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe aortic valve calcification with new aortic insufficiency. Blood and urine cultures returned positive for Aerococcus urinae. A transesophageal echocardiogram further confirmed moderate to severe aortic regurgitation with findings suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE), see Figures , .\nAntibiotics were expanded to include gentamicin with ceftriaxone for IE, and surgical evaluation was consulted. Given she was a high-risk surgical candidate, surgery intervention was not offered at this time unless evidence of further clinical decompensation. Additional surgical recommendations included re-evaluation after completion of antibiotic course. She was therefore discharged on intravenous antibiotics to complete a total of six weeks of treatment with ceftriaxone and two weeks of gentamicin. Soon after completion, the patient returned due to worsening thrombocytopenia that had previously improved upon discharge. On readmission, repeat labs were most notable for worsening thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia. The patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR and physical exam concerning for decompensated heart failure. Despite administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and heart rate control, the patient continued to decline, and her clinical picture was consistent with cardiogenic shock. In addition to respiratory distress, the patient went into ventricular fibrillation arrest.

Her history was notable for a background history of congenital biliary atresia (BA). She had undergone an early Kasai portoenterostomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis in the early neonatal period. Her subsequent postoperative course was complicated by two episodes of cholangitis. By the age of two she had developed portal hypertension resulting in secondary thrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism. She had developed esophageal varices requiring annual sclerotherapy until the age of sixteen when she underwent variceal banding. Her vaccinations were up-to-date.\nGeneral findings on presentation at 11 weeks revealed icterus with scattered spider naevi. On abdominal inspection there was an upper abdominal scar from her prior surgery and on palpation the spleen was enlarged extending to below the level of the umbilicus; there was no evidence of ascites.\nAn ultrasound confirmed her estimated date of delivery. She was referred to the medical clinic at the hospital to provide a multidisciplinary team input to her care.\nAt sixteen weeks she developed an episode of cholangitis and she was treated with intravenous antibiotics for seven days. A liver ultrasound was performed. This revealed absence of intrahepatic dilatation with multiple periportal and peripancreatic varices and 14 cm splenomegaly. During the pregnancy her platelets remained low (29\u201355 \u00d7 109 L) and hemoglobin ranged from 8.8 to 10.5 g/dL. Her transaminases were marginally elevated (AST/ALT, 46/67) and coagulation parameters were normal. Significant concern remained about her thrombocytopenia and degree of hypersplenism.\nA multidisciplinary meeting was convened with hepatology, hepatobiliary surgery, and interventional radiology. Concerns for this patient included her significant splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, risk of recurrent cholangitis, potential for massive variceal hemorrhage, and potential for preterm delivery, either spontaneous or iatrogenic. Abdominal delivery would also be compromised by large venous anastomoses in the anterior abdominal wall. A plan for management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage was outlined. Further imaging of her portal vessels was recommended as this would inform the interventional radiologists as to which was the optimum surgical intervention should bleeding develop from intraabdominal varices. The option of a splenectomy in pregnancy was excluded as this was deemed likely to cause portal vein thrombosis and would compromise any future candidacy for liver transplantation. At twenty weeks she underwent MR venography of the portal vessels. Her spleen measured 23 cm, there was evidence of extensive splenic and esophageal varices, and no lienorenal shunt was identified.\nShe had bimonthly antenatal visits with her obstetrical and hepatology teams. Her anatomy scan was within normal limits with a well-grown fetus on the 31st centile. Due to the complexity of the case and the potential for preterm delivery she received two doses of betamethasone at twenty-six weeks of gestation to aid lung maturation.\nAt 26+3 she presented to the maternity hospital with vaginal bleeding, suprapubic pressure, and uterine contractions for 24 hours with increasing intensity and duration. The fundal height was consistent with 26 weeks of pregnancy and cardiotocography was reassuring. Sterile speculum examination confirmed that the cervix was 5 cm dilated and fully effaced and the amniotic membranes were bulging through the cervix. A bedside ultrasound scan confirmed a breech presentation. Her platelet count was 33 \u00d7 109/L. Following consultation with perioperative medicine, the hepatobiliary team, and neonatology the decision was made to perform an emergency caesarean section. It had been planned to perform her surgery in a general hospital; however, due to the acute nature of her presentation the caesarean section was undertaken in the obstetric facility, with hepatobiliary surgery and interventional radiology on standby in the general hospital. Pooled platelets were administered immediately prior to surgery. Magnesium sulphate was administered to provide fetal neuroprotection. The caesarean section was performed via a vertical subumbilical incision, with a lower segment transverse incision on the uterus. The vertical incision was utilized both to provide greater access to the abdominal cavity should bleeding occur, either from the uterus or the varices, and to avoid large venous collaterals running vertically in the abdominal wall. A live male baby was delivered by breech extraction and transferred to the pediatric team following delayed cord clamping of 45 seconds. Apgar's scores were 61, 65, and 710; the cord blood gases were pH 7.27 (arterial) 7.29 (venous). The infant weighed 890 grams. The remainder of the surgery was uneventful. Perioperatively she received a further pooled platelet transfusion with good hemostasis and no transfusion of packed red cells was required. Her baby was transferred to intensive care and initially required CPAP. He had an uncomplicated neonatal course. Histology of the placenta was unremarkable. The patient had an uneventful postpartum course. She was advised against further pregnancies in view of her significant risks and underwent insertion of a levonorgestrel coil at three months postpartum for contraceptive purposes and she is currently awaiting liver transplantation.

During the transport, the cardiocirculatory parameters were relatively stable with a systolic pressure around 100 mmHg. The capnometry after return of spontaneous circulation measured a pCO2 of 60 mmHg. Upon arrival at the hospital, the physical examination showed jugular vein distension but no peripheral oedema.\nEchocardiography performed in the emergency department revealed a pericardial tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis via the subxiphoidal route, 800 mL of blood were initially evacuated. The differential diagnosis included primary respiratory failure or a sudden cardiac death with secondary pericardial effusion induced by cardiac compressions under double antiplatelet therapy, a ruptured aortic aneurysm, a myocardial rupture, or a primary laceration of a cardiac structure by the LAA occluder. A ruptured aneurysm of the ascending aorta was excluded by ultrasound. Electrocardiogram examination did not demonstrate any ST-segment elevation or low voltage. Blood gas analysis documented a stable respiratory situation with a pO2 of 230 mmHg and a pCO2 of 55 mmHg, the pH was 7, 3 and Lactate elevated with 10 mmol/L (<2 mmol/L).

The chest X-ray demonstrated the proper placement of the endotracheal and pericardial tube and ruled out a pneumothorax or pulmonary oedema.\nIn the hours following pericardiocentesis, approximately 2 L of blood were evacuated. Conventional methods of coagulopathy management including application of tranexamic acid, fresh frozen plasma, and fibrinogen did not stop the bleeding. To stabilize the patient a total of eight packs of red blood cells were transfused.\nIn preparation of cardiac surgery, a coronary angiogram was performed (). It revealed active leakage of contrast agent in the proximal circumflex artery and the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery department immediately. Intra-operatively a perforation of the tissue at the basis of the LAA close to the left main coronary artery was discovered. Under protection of cold blood cardioplegia on cardiopulmonary bypass the occluder was excised through the opened left atrium. The LAA was closed by endocardial sutures and two pledget sutures were used to seal the epicardial lesion at the LAA basis which stopped the bleeding.

The patient had been bed-bound from arthritis in a nursing home, but her mental status had been intact. The patient had recently been hospitalized over 3 weeks ago for COVID-19 pneumonia and was discharged home with home hospice one week before readmission.\nAccording to her family, the patient's mental status had severely declined during her previous hospitalization with COVID-19. She developed staring spells after discharge that culminated into generalized tonic-clonic seizures on the day of the current admission. The episode lasted two seconds. Per her hospice nurse, blood pressures and blood glucose were well controlled at home. The home medications were thoroughly reviewed and found not to have any typical pharmacologic culprits. When she presented to the emergency department, she had two more witnessed seizures. Her blood pressure during this episode was 227/95 mm Hg, her heart rate was 98 beats/min, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, her respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 93% while she breathed room air. Intravenous labetalol, lorazepam, and levetiracetam were administered. Her blood pressure decreased to 160/70 mm Hg and remained well controlled during her hospitalization. Head CT and basic laboratory work () were unremarkable. Her physical exam was notable for postictal confusion. She was alert and only oriented to person. An electroencephalogram (EEG) detected no evidence of seizure or epileptiform discharges, but generalized slowing with an intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral temporal regions was noticed (). Brain MRI demonstrated subcortical and cortical FLAIR signal abnormality involving the left greater than right parieto-occipital lobes and the left temporal lobe, in a pattern most compatible with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (Figures \u2013). There was no acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.\nThe patient had no further seizures after being treated with levetiracetam. Her mental state gradually returned to normal. She became more eager to participate in physical therapy and be more independent. She set a goal to walk without her walker and to cook for her family and friends. Her family was pleasantly surprised by this improvement in her mentation. She had no further seizure activity in the hospital and was discharged back home with home care services. She is doing well six months after discharge, is seizure-free, and follows her scheduled appointments.

We also know the patient is 90 years old and has a history of type 2 diabetes. There is no mention of stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, or heart failure.

He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for \u223c15\u201320 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.\nHe had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.\nThe patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At \u223c7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted \u223c1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min\u22121 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).\nCardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device.
