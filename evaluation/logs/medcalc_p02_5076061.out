 Here is the patient note:
A 63-year-old man with history of hypertension and glucose intolerance since age 59 years was emergently admitted to our Institution from a peripheral Hospital for evaluation of a severe, constant posterior chest pain, radiating forward, and dyspnoea with a suspected diagnosis of acute aortic dissection.
On physical examination the patient was not shocked, his pulse was 87 beats/min, blood pressure 150/105 mmHg. He had truncal obesity, a "moon face" and proximal muscle weakness. An electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy. His laboratory work-up revealed anaemia (Hb 10.7 g/dl), hypokaliemia (3.4 mEq/L), metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 35 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemia (170 mg/dl). A CT scan of thorax and abdomen demonstrated a dissection starting just below left succlavian artery and extending downward to the left renal artery, involving the celiac tripod and superior mesenteric artery (). The dissection was classified as Stanford B, De Bakey III. Moreover CT scan of abdomen revealed incidentally a left adrenal tumour of 25 mm of diameter.
The patient was pharmacologically treated and was felt at risk for impending aortic rupture. Therefore, an emergent endograft positioning was planned. Our goal was to exclude the damaged segment of the aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and at the secondary tears along the vessel). Through an inguinal incision, the right common, superficial and profunda femoral artery were dissected free. A prosthetic graft (Valiant, Medtronic, Sunnyvale, CA, USA 42 mm x 198 mm) was placed just below the origin of the left succlavian artery up to the diaphragmatic hiatus. A postoperative control CT scan demonstrated the correct graft positioning, not endoleaks and the closure of all secondary tears ().
This patient was evaluated for hypercortisolism and the plasma cortisol was increased to 33.9 Œºg/dl (vn, value of normal, 5.6-23 Œºg/dl) without circadian rhythm and not suppressed by the administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone (overnight text: 9.8 Œºg/dl; vn <1.8 Œºg/dl ). The plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was less than 10 pg/ml (vn 12-60 pg/ml) and 24h urinary free cortisol excretion (UFC) was elevated 465.6 Œºg/24 h (vn 26-135 Œºg/24h ).
A MRI of abdomen was performed to have a more accurate evaluation of the adrenal mass, it was of 2 cm of diameter, well capsulated, hyperintense in T1 sequences with a normal reduction of signal in T2 weighted sequences ().
A diagnosis of CS was made on basis of the endocrinological tests and for the presence of left adrenocortical lesion. Via laparotomic approach, a left adrenalectomy was performed during intravenous replacement of hydrocortisone, ACE-inhibitor, aspirin and insulin therapy.
Six months after adrenalectomy, blood pressure was controlled (135/75 mmHg) with anti-hypertensive therapy, laboratory analysis revealed glycaemia 102 mg/dl, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 5.7%, potassium 4.26 mEq/l, sodium 139.7 mEq/L, plasma creatinine 1.05 g/dl, a.m. plasma cortiso l9.7 Œºg/dl, plasma ACTH 28 pg/ml and UFC 45 Œºg/24h.

 Here is the patient note:
A 59-year-old man diagnosed with obstructive hydrocephalus was scheduled for an ETV. The patient had a medical history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension that was being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a beta blocker. The body mass index was 33.8, but he had no respiratory symptoms, including sleep apnea. A preoperative chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but electrocardiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. The patient's symptoms were amnesia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence that had persisted for 5 months; preoperatively, he was alert and cooperative and had no problem communicating. The preoperative vital signs were: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 59 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 96%. Since the appearance of the patient suggested a possible difficult intubation, a video laryngoscope was used for tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia with 150 mg propofol 1%, 40 mg lidocaine 2%, and 60 mg rocuronium. The vocal cord was clearly visible on the video laryngoscope and the intubation was accomplished without trauma or other difficulties. Anesthesia was maintained with 5% desflurane and 0.02 ¬µg/kg/min remifentanil, and air with 50% oxygen. The surgery lasted 2 hours and required no additional muscle relaxants. During the surgery, there was sudden and sustained hypotension (mean blood pressure 52‚Äì57 mmHg) with bradycardia (heart rate 45‚Äì55 beats/min) that did not respond well to ephedrine; these complications began about 10 min after the beginning of the surgery and lasted for 25 min until a dopamine infusion was administered that restored normal blood pressure. Remifentanil infusion was discontinued at the onset of hypotension and bradycardia. After the purge of volatile agents at the end of the surgery, the train of four (TOF) count was 4, and the ratio was 50%, so 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected. The patient recovered muscle power within a few minutes, showing firm hand grip, head elevation, and mouth opening, and was fully obeying verbal commands, but was not opening his eyes. As he was alert and cooperative at that point and no other neurologic deficit was observed, the neurosurgeons thought that the inability to open his eyes was not related to the surgery. We relieved the bandage on the head in order to reduce the chance of unintended pressure or tension on the forehead, and suggested that further neurologic examinations be done after full recovery from anesthesia. Spontaneous respiration was present, showing expired tidal volumes reaching 500 ml each time, but was tachypneic; the patient's respiratory rate ranged from 40 to 50 breaths/min. This condition continued for 5 min, at which time the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU under mask ventilation. The patient showed signs of inspiratory stridor, chest retractions, and hoarse voice after the extubation. The patient's accessory respiratory muscles were not involved in the hyperventilation. There was no crackle or wheezing clear on auscultation besides the inspiratory stridor, but the findings were not clear on account of the hoarse voice and the rapid and dynamic ventilation. An additional 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected in the PACU under the theory that the patient's upper airway was obstructed because of possible residual paralysis but the condition did not change. The patient was fully responsive to verbal commands but was still unable to open his eyes or hold his breath and he complained of feeling like he was choking despite the hyperventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) at that point showed: pH, 7.35; pCO2, 37 mmHg; pO2, 76 mmHg; HCO3, 20.4 mmol/L; and O2 saturation, 94%. The vital signs at that point were: blood pressure, 150/90 mmHg; heart rate, 110 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 44 breaths/min. Since tachypnea (40‚Äì50 breaths/min) persisted for 20 min in the PACU and oxygen saturation started to drop under 95%, 200 mg thiopental sodium and 100 mg succinylcholine were injected and endotracheal intubation was performed. Endotracheal suction was done immediately after intubation and there was no sputum or discharge. Auscultation right after the re-intubation sounded smooth, without crackle or wheezing, and the oxygen saturation rapidly corrected to 100%. Tachypnea persisted even under sedation after the succinylcholine wore off, so a central cause was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive pneumocephalus with pneumoventricle and hydrocephalus (). A chest X-ray taken after the brain CT showed no pathologic findings such as pulmonary edema, congestion, or pneumothorax. On the neurosurgeon's recommendation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was kept there for three days under mechanical ventilation with sedation with midazolam, cisatracurium, and rocuronium until the pneumocephalus and tachypnea spontaneously resolved. Follow-up chest radiographs were taken over the next 3 weeks and showed nothing abnormal. According to a pulmonology consultation, the tachypnea was not likely to have originated from pulmonary problems. ABGA results stayed within normal limits under fully controlled mechanical ventilation but showed hypoxemia when the patient gained spontaneous respiration during the sedative period before the resolution of the pneumocephalus. Since the follow-up chest X-rays showed no abnormal findings, pulmonary embolism evaluation including embolism CT and laboratory examinations, which also showed nothing abnormal, were done on the recommendation of a pulmonologist. When a follow-up brain CT showed resolution of the pneumocephalus on the 3rd day after the surgery, sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents were discontinued and the mechanical ventilation mode was switched to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The respiratory rate at that point ranged from 15 to 20 breaths/min and ABGA results remained normal when the patient gained consciousness and self-respiration, so the endotracheal tube was extubated. The patient is now (30 days post-operation) in the general ward; he is mentally alert and has stable vital signs but still is unable to open his eyes because of bilateral ptosis and is receiving conservative treatment.

The patient had a medical history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension that was being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a beta blocker. The body mass index was 33.8, but he had no respiratory symptoms, including sleep apnea. A preoperative chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but electrocardiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. The patient's symptoms were amnesia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence that had persisted for 5 months; preoperatively, he was alert and cooperative and had no problem communicating. The preoperative vital signs were: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 59 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 96%. Since the appearance of the patient suggested a possible difficult intubation, a video laryngoscope was used for tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia with 150 mg propofol 1%, 40 mg lidocaine 2%, and 60 mg rocuronium. The vocal cord was clearly visible on the video laryngoscope and the intubation was accomplished without trauma or other difficulties. Anesthesia was maintained with 5% desflurane and 0.02 ¬µg/kg/min remifentanil, and air with 50% oxygen. The surgery lasted 2 hours and required no additional muscle relaxants. During the surgery, there was sudden and sustained hypotension (mean blood pressure 52‚Äì57 mmHg) with bradycardia (heart rate 45‚Äì55 beats/min) that did not respond well to ephedrine; these complications began about 10 min after the beginning of the surgery and lasted for 25 min until a dopamine infusion was administered that restored normal blood pressure. Remifentanil infusion was discontinued at the onset of hypotension and bradycardia. After the purge of volatile agents at the end of the surgery, the train of four (TOF) count was 4, and the ratio was 50%, so 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected. The patient recovered muscle power within a few minutes, showing firm hand grip, head elevation, and mouth opening, and was fully obeying verbal commands, but was not opening his eyes. As he was alert and cooperative at that point and no other neurologic deficit was observed, the neurosurgeons thought that the inability to open his eyes was not related to the surgery. We relieved the bandage on the head in order to reduce the chance of unintended pressure or tension on the forehead, and suggested that further neurologic examinations be done after full recovery from anesthesia. Spontaneous respiration was present, showing expired tidal volumes reaching 500 ml each time, but was tachypneic; the patient's respiratory rate ranged from 40 to 50 breaths/min. This condition continued for 5 min, at which time the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU under mask ventilation. The patient showed signs of inspiratory stridor, chest retractions, and hoarse voice after the extubation. The patient's accessory respiratory muscles were not involved in the hyperventilation. There was no crackle or wheezing clear on auscultation besides the inspiratory stridor, but the findings were not clear on account of the hoarse voice and the rapid and dynamic ventilation. An additional 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected in the PACU under the theory that the patient's upper airway was obstructed because of possible residual paralysis but the condition did not change. The patient was fully responsive to verbal commands but was still unable to open his eyes or hold his breath and he complained of feeling like he was choking despite the hyperventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) at that point showed: pH, 7.35; pCO2, 37 mmHg; pO2, 76 mmHg; HCO3, 20.4 mmol/L; and O2 saturation, 94%. The vital signs at that point were: blood pressure, 150/90 mmHg; heart rate, 110 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 44 breaths/min. Since tachypnea (40‚Äì50 breaths/min) persisted for 20 min in the PACU and oxygen saturation started to drop under 95%, 200 mg thiopental sodium and 100 mg succinylcholine were injected and endotracheal intubation was performed. Endotracheal suction was done immediately after intubation and there was no sputum or discharge. Auscultation right after the re-intubation sounded smooth, without crackle or wheezing, and the oxygen saturation rapidly corrected to 100%. Tachypnea persisted even under sedation after the succinylcholine wore off, so a central cause was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive pneumocephalus with pneumoventricle and hydrocephalus (). A chest X-ray taken after the brain CT showed no pathologic findings such as pulmonary edema, congestion, or pneumothorax. On the neurosurgeon's recommendation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was kept there for three days under mechanical ventilation with sedation with midazolam, cisatracurium, and rocuronium until the pneumocephalus and tachypnea spontaneously resolved. Follow-up chest radiographs were taken over the next 3 weeks and showed nothing abnormal. According to a pulmonology consultation, the tachypnea was not likely to have originated from pulmonary problems. ABGA results stayed within normal limits under fully controlled mechanical ventilation but showed hypoxemia when the patient gained spontaneous respiration during the sedative period before the resolution of the pneumocephalus. Since the follow-up chest X-rays showed no abnormal findings, pulmonary embolism evaluation including embolism CT and laboratory examinations, which also showed nothing abnormal, were done on the recommendation of a pulmonologist. When a follow-up brain CT showed resolution of the pneumocephalus on the 3rd day after the surgery, sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents were discontinued and the mechanical ventilation mode was switched to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The respiratory rate at that point ranged from 15 to 20 breaths/min and ABGA results remained normal when the patient gained consciousness and self-respiration, so the endotracheal tube was extubated. The patient is now (30 days post-operation) in the general ward; he is mentally alert and has stable vital signs but still is unable to open his eyes because of bilateral ptosis and is receiving conservative treatment.", 'Question': "What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?", 'LLM Answer': '4', 'LLM Explanation': "To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to identify the patient's history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, and sex. From the patient note, we can extract the following information: the patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension, which is being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a beta blocker. The patient is 59 years old, which falls within the high-risk age range. The patient has a body mass index of 33.8, which is classified as obese. The patient has no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, or atrial fibrillation. The patient is male, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we can calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score as follows: 1 point for hypertension, 2 points for age (59-64), 1 point for diabetes, and 0 points for stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, and sex. The total score is 4.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '2', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.\nThe patient is 59.0 years old. Because the age is less than 65 years, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0.\nThe patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0.\nThe patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0.\nThe patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nOne criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Because stroke history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because tia history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because thromboembolism history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 1.\nBased on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 1. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is present. Because the patient has diabetes, one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 2.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 78-year-old female patient, temporarily admitted to the recovery department after ECT, developed atrial fibrillation and chest pain. Her medical history showed hypertension, severe depression and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Her ECG 3 months before ECT was completely normal. Immediately after ECT her blood pressure was 230/140 mmHg, but later decreased to 110/45 mmHg. Examination of heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 140 beats/min and new negative T waves in leads I, II, aVL and V2-6. The second ECG showed sinus rhythm and persisting negative T-waves (Fig. ). Troponin T level was 0.02 Œºg/l (normal) and no other laboratory abnormalities were found. A differential diagnosis was made and the following possible causes were taken into account: post ECT, post tachycardia due to atrial fibrillation, severe hypertension or myocardial ischaemia. Since the patient reported to have had previous anginal complaints, coronary angiography was performed. In the left anterior descending artery two significant stenoses were identified in the proximal and the mid section, respectively. Furthermore, a stenosis was found in the right coronary artery. Due to her psychiatric condition, PCI was not performed and she was treated with anti-anginal medication and warfarin.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient was a 64-year-old man affected by a persistent nodular lesion of the cheek mucosa. More precisely, he presented with a blue-violet, sessile, painless, and nonbleeding lesion of the cheek lasting one year (Figure ). He reported occasional biting trauma. Warfarin therapy had been prescribed for the patient for chronic atrial fibrillation. The clinical diagnosis was of venous malformation, as confirmed by ultrasound investigation. Following a careful explanation of the treatment, the patient agreed to transmucosal photocoagulation by DL without suspension of warfarin treatment. After a small amount of local anesthesia, we used the DL (wavelength 910 ¬± 10 nm; pulsed-wave; fiber of 400 microns; output energy 5 W) to directly photocoagulate the lesion, and the treatment ended when its color varied from blue-violet to grayish-white (Figure ). The irradiated area healed in 14 days without recurrence (Figure ).

 Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old man who had alcoholic liver disease and chronic hepatitis C-related Child-Pugh class C liver cirrhosis was brought to our emergency department by ambulance, exhibiting fever, short of breath and a localized wound pain over left ankle. The patient presented with dyspnea, lower extremity edema and some wounds over bilateral ankles area for 1 day before admission, but had no other symptoms, including a headache, sore throat, cough, and chest, abdominal, and back pain. He had alcohol and chronic hepatitis C- related liver cirrhosis, and took diuretics in the past 5 years. He drank approximately 60 g of alcohol per day for more than 20 years, but recently had been taking a bit more than usual.
His laboratory data 2 weeks before admission were 6.5 mg/ dl of total bilirubin, 2.1 g/dl of albumin, and 1.73 of international normalized ratio. In addition, he had moderate ascites, which was medically controlled. These findings were indicative of Child- Pugh class C liver cirrhosis. On arrival, he appeared to be in disturbance and distress that was classified as 13 (E3V4M6) on the Glasgow Coma Scale. His vital signs were 132/106 mmHg of blood pressure, 125 beats/minute of pulse rate, 24 breaths/minute of respiratory rate, and 38.4 ¬∞C of body temperature. Auscultation of the lung and heart revealed coarse breath sounds and rapid irregular heartbeats. His abdomen was soft and swollen. Two wounds with redness and swelling (measures 0.5 √ó 0.5 cm, left ankle; measures 1 √ó 1 cm, right ankle) were found on his lower extremities ( and ). Chest X-ray indicated a lower lobe infiltration and a mild blunting of C-P angle in the right side (). ECG showed atrial fibrillation.
Laboratory findings also included 8,990/ml of white blood cell count with 94% neutrophils and 3% lymphocytes, 11.1 g/dl of hemoglobin level, 104,000/ml of platelet count, 23 mg/dl of blood urea nitrogen, 1.42 mg/dl of creatinine, 121 mmol/L of sodium, and 4.6 mmol/L of potassium. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrated 152 cells/mm3 of ascitic white blood cell count and 30 cells/mm3 of polymorphonuclear cell count 10 hours later after his arrival of emergency department. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated a severe metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.38, pCO2: 20.4 mmHg, pO2: 91.8 mmHg; base deficit: 11.2 mmol/L), which was indicative of septic shock.
Oxacillin treatment under the impression of cellulitis was administered 2 hours after his arrival; two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Rapid fluid resuscitation was performed and immediately developed by tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Although there was no significant change of ankle wounds, antibiotic regimen with a combination of ceftriaxone and clindamycin was adjusted due to persistent hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation and high dose vasopressor use and clinical suspicion of Vibrio vulnificus related necrotizing fasciitis.
One episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with manifestations of fresh blood in the nasogastric tube occurred on Day 2. Blood transfusion with 2 units of packed red blood cells was given. Despite intensive support efforts, the patient died on Day 3 after the sudden change. And after that, his blood and ascites cultures were positive for A. hydrophila.

The patient presented with dyspnea, lower extremity edema and some wounds over bilateral ankles area for 1 day before admission, but had no other symptoms, including a headache, sore throat, cough, and chest, abdominal, and back pain. He had alcohol and chronic hepatitis C- related liver cirrhosis, and took diuretics in the past 5 years. He drank approximately 60 g of alcohol per day for more than 20 years, but recently had been taking a bit more than usual. His laboratory data 2 weeks before admission were 6.5 mg/ dl of total bilirubin, 2.1 g/dl of albumin, and 1.73 of international normalized ratio. In addition, he had moderate ascites, which was medically controlled. These findings were indicative of Child- Pugh class C liver cirrhosis. On arrival, he appeared to be in disturbance and distress that was classified as 13 (E3V4M6) on the Glasgow Coma Scale. His vital signs were 132/106 mmHg of blood pressure, 125 beats/minute of pulse rate, 24 breaths/minute of respiratory rate, and 38.4 ¬∞C of body temperature. Auscultation of the lung and heart revealed coarse breath sounds and rapid irregular heartbeats. His abdomen was soft and swollen. Two wounds with redness and swelling (measures 0.5 √ó 0.5 cm, left ankle; measures 1 √ó 1 cm, right ankle) were found on his lower extremities ( and ). Chest X-ray indicated a lower lobe infiltration and a mild blunting of C-P angle in the right side (). ECG showed atrial fibrillation. Laboratory findings also included 8,990/ml of white blood cell count with 94% neutrophils and 3% lymphocytes, 11.1 g/dl of hemoglobin level, 104,000/ml of platelet count, 23 mg/dl of blood urea nitrogen, 1.42 mg/dl of creatinine, 121 mmol/L of sodium, and 4.6 mmol/L of potassium. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrated 152 cells/mm3 of ascitic white blood cell count and 30 cells/mm3 of polymorphonuclear cell count 10 hours later after his arrival of emergency department. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated a severe metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.38, pCO2: 20.4 mmHg, pO2: 91.8 mmHg; base deficit: 11.2 mmol/L), which was indicative of septic shock. Oxacillin treatment under the impression of cellulitis was administered 2 hours after his arrival; two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Rapid fluid resuscitation was performed and immediately developed by tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Although there was no significant change of ankle wounds, antibiotic regimen with a combination of ceftriaxone and clindamycin was adjusted due to persistent hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation and high dose vasopressor use and clinical suspicion of Vibrio vulnificus related necrotizing fasciitis.

 Here is the patient note:
A 62-year-old male presented to Samsung Medical Center with a 40-year history of paroxysmal palpitations. Although diagnosed with atrial septal defect (ASD) 30 years previously, the patient elected not to undergo surgical repair. Approximately 1 year prior, he began to visit the pediatric ward of Samsung Medical Center more frequently with symptoms of palpitations and dyspnea lasting 2 to 3 days and occurring in 2- to 3-month intervals. An electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and secundum-type ASD (22.3 mm) with a left-to-right shunt was diagnosed by echocardiogram. Device closure (Amplatzer septal occlude 28 mm; AGA Medical, Golden Valley, MN, USA) was then performed; however, 1 week after the procedure, the patient continued to experience dyspnea and chest pain after 10 to 20 minutes of walking. Sustained atrial fibrillation was seen on the electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. Cardioversion was performed following hospitalization with the opinion that the persistent atrial fibrillation was due to device closure. The patient was discharged from the hospital after cardioversion to sinus rhythm at 100 J; however, the symptoms recurred. Since it was difficult to perform radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) due to the recent device closure, the patient was referred to the thoracic surgery department for totally thoracoscopic ablation. Surgery was performed under routine procedures. Intubation was performed using a double lumen endotracheal tube. For the surgery, a 10-mm trocar was inserted in the fourth intercostal space (ICS) of the right anterior axillary line, a 5-mm trocar in the third ICS along the anterior axillary line, and a 10-mm trocar in the sixth ICS on the mid-axillary line. Right pulmonary vein ablation, right ganglionated plexi ablation, and ablation of the right half of the space between the right lower pulmonary vein and the left lower pulmonary vein were performed. Between the procedures, we conducted a high-frequency stimulation test for finding ganglionated plexi. Sutures were placed after chest tube insertion. On the left side, ports were placed in the same positions, and ablations were performed in the same order as on the right side after dividing Marshall‚Äôs ligament (). A left atrial auricle resection was then performed using an Echelon Flex 60 articulating endoscopic linear cutter (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). Upon confirmation of the conversion to sinus rhythm, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. He was then transferred to the general ward on postoperative day 1 and discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 6. During this 6-day postoperative period, the sinus rhythm was maintained continuously. Six months later, the sinus rhythm was seen on the 24-hour Holter monitor; the patient showed none of the earlier symptoms, and therefore, amiodarone and warfarin were stopped. The patient is currently being followed as an outpatient, and his sinus rhythm has been well maintained as seen on the last electrocardiogram at the 8 month follow-up.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old female presented with a chief complaint for evaluation of an incidental finding of peripancreatic lymph node.
She underwent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis as part of her routine surveillance for extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT-lymphoma) of the lung and was found to have peripancreatic lymph node. She denied any abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, weight loss, nausea, or vomiting.
Her medical history was significant for MALT-lymphoma, invasive lobular breast carcinoma, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, mitral valve prolapse, mitral valve stenosis, and actinic keratosis. Her surgical history included a mastectomy with sentinel lymph node dissection, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy, left knee replacement, and bilateral carpal tunnel repair.
Her family history was significant for colon cancer in maternal grandmother at the age of 65 years, prostate cancer in brother at the age of 63 years, and melanoma in mother. She had no history of alcohol or tobacco abuse. She has 2 children and attained menopause at the age of 52 years. Her medications included aspirin, furosemide, carvedilol, rosuvastatin, amiodarone, digoxin, anastrozole, and Eliquis.
Her physical examination was unremarkable, and her abdomen was soft nontender, nondistended with no palpable mass.
Laboratory exam including fractionated metanephrines, chromogranin, and gastrin were negative.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed 2 cm √ó 1.1 cm lymph node adjacent to the pancreatic head (Figure ).
EUS showed a 19 mm √ó 11.5 mm hypoechoic lesion near the pancreatic head (Figure ). Two FNA passes using a 25-gauge needle were performed via transduodenal approach (Figure ).
Direct FNA smears showed tumor with neuroendocrine features. Initial immunoperoxidase stains performed on cell block sections were positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin, which seemed to confirm the morphologic impression of PNET. The pathologist was subsequently informed about the peripancreatic location and lack of a definite pancreatic lesion.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient was a 76-year-old man with a history of mild dysphasia. He had a prior history of cerebral infarctions (x3) at the age of 66, 74 and 75 years, with a first instance of swallowing difficulties after the third stroke. At that time, dysphasia rehabilitation was initiated within 3 days of the stroke, and he recovered the ability to eat a regular meal within 2 weeks. In January 2018, 1-year after his last stroke, he underwent surgery for spinal stenosis, followed by a 10-day period of bedrest. His physical activity level subsequently declined due to back pain, and he lost 10 kg within the 10 months after surgery. Swallowing difficulties re-emerged in September 2018, with the patient only able to tolerate soft meals. His dysphasia worsened, with an increase in sputum and development of a chronic cough.
His medical history included cerebral infarctions (x3), diabetes mellitus, spinal stenosis, and hypertension. His height was 168.8 cm, with a body weight of 56.5 kg. He had a right hemiplegia, with the following functional measures: grip strength, 25 kg; gait speed, 0.7 m/s, assessed using the 5-m walk test; and skeletal mass index, 6.6 kg/m2. His score of 5 points on the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form was indicative of malnourishment. Absence of another cerebral infarct was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Video-endoscopic swallowing assessment showed saliva pooling in the pharynx, widening of the pharyngeal space, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A). Video-fluorography revealed a decrease in the forward movement of the larynx, a widened pharyngeal space, weakened pharyngeal constriction, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A‚ÄìC). Functional swallowing scores were as follows: Hyodo score, 9; Fujishima grade, 6; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 4. A probable diagnosis of sarcopenic dysphagia was made, based on the criteria defined by Mori et al. [] Clinical management included swallowing training, a high-protein diet, and nutritional guidance. The patient declined additional rehabilitation, due to his previous experience post-stroke. Therefore, we presented laryngeal suspension as a possible alternative treatment, which was performed in December 2018.
Laryngeal suspension was performed via a minimally invasive thyromadibulopexy, using two skin incisions: one (2-cm) incision at the level of the mandible and the other (3-cm) between the hyoid bone and the superior border of the thyroid cartilage (A). Identified the white line, divided aside the anterior cervical muscles, and exposed the thyroid cartilage. Also the mandible was exposed. Two holes in the mandibular and six holes in the thyroid cartilage was made by using drill. The thyroid cartilage was fixed to the mandible using No. 2 nylon. No. 2 nylon thread was passed through the Gore-tex sheet cut to the size of thyroid cartilage. And it was passed through the thyroid cartilage, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, mandible, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, and tied to the other side of the nylon. As the two holes of the middle of the thyroid cartilage, two No. 2 nylons was crossed to fix the thyroid cartilage and mandible. The larynx was suspended about one vertebral body by totally using five No. 2 nylons (B), confirmed by X-ray fluoroscopy. A 1-cm incision was performed for tracheotomy, and cuffed tracheal cannula was inserted for airway management.
Maintaining some neck flexion for a period of 1-week was conducted. Nutritional support was initiated via gastrostomy tube feeding. The cuffed tracheal cannula was changed to an uncuffed cannula on postoperative day (POD) 1. The wound was stable and there was no pain. Swallowing was initiated using jelly and cold tea, with the patient in a flat lateral position. The tracheal cannula was removed on POD 4. Video-fluorography revealed contrast agent residue in the vallecular but with a decrease in residue in the pyriform sinus compared to pre-operative measures, with no evidence of aspiration on POD 6 (A‚ÄìC). Anterosuperior movement of the larynx was improved, reaching one vertebral level higher than before surgery. The swallowing reflex was maintained, with sufficient opening of the esophageal orifice, avoiding the need for mandibular protrusion to swallow. Swallowing using modified food was initiated in a sitting position on POD 6 and the gastrostomy tube was removed on POD 7. Video-endoscopic examination confirmed his ability to eat a rice cracker and noodles without aspiration and no evidence of pharyngeal residue on POD 11 (B). The patient was able to eat soft meals on POD 14, and a regular meal on POD 18, and was discharged on POD 21. The patient gained 2 kg in the 2 months after surgery, with improvement in functional scores: Hyodo score, 5; Fujishima grade, 8; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 6. There was no exacerbation of the condition over a 10-month period after surgery, and the patient has a normal diet and is able to travel. Neck movement restriction was not severe.

 Here is the patient note:
An obese 42-year-old African American male with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, coronary arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation presented with new onset right-sided chest pain and a palpable right chest mass. Ultrasound showed an anterior right chest, well-demarcated 7.5 √ó 6.5 √ó 4.8 cm, intramuscular mass, 0.6 cm deep to the skin. CT demonstrated a 9x9x9cm necrotic mass arising from the pectoralis major. CT-guided core biopsy was positive for high-grade spindle cell neoplasm (positive for smooth muscle actin, desmin, S100, and CD31; negative for CD34, PAX8, and beta-catenin) and verified by two independent pathologists.
Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow up after referral to Oncology and Thoracic Surgery. He presented to oncology clinic with progressive symptoms including a rapidly enlarging chest mass, increasing pain, and new onset chest wall numbness. A repeat CT showed that the mass increased in size to 21.4 √ó 17.8 √ó 13.7 cm without evidence of metastatic disease over course of two months. MRI was consistent with 23 cm mass within the right pectoralis major without vascular or bony invasion. The patient chose to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy given his multiple comorbidities. He was hesitant to pursue resection and elected to attempt to shrink the tumor before resection.
Patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and docetaxel for 2 cycles followed by radiation therapy (50Gy over 2 months to tumor bed + 3 cm margins). Restaging CT showed a stable tumor at 23 cm without any evidence of local or distant metastases.
The patient returned to Thoracic surgery clinic to discuss options for resection and reconstruction. He then underwent wide local surgical resection for definitive therapy. Tumor was removed en bloc with resection to the intercostal fascia including pectoralis major and minor (Fig. ). There did not appear to be any violation of the intercostal investing fascia and no entry into the thoracic cavity was made. Negative pressure dressing was used until post-operative day 7 when Plastic Surgery performed advancement flap coverage and skin grafting to the > 1,000cm2 defect (Fig. a, b).
Final pathology demonstrated 38x20x18 cm tumor with 70% gross necrosis and R0 resection. Microscopic examination confirmed high-grade sarcoma with smooth muscle differentiation (Fig. ). Final pathologic staging based on AJCC 7th edition was Stage III G3 pT2bNxMx.

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes developed acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia (NIHSS score on admission: 4). He arrived at our hospital 45 min later. On admission, his blood pressure was 160/70 mm Hg; atrial fibrillation was detected on electrocardiography. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) revealed no early signs of cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient was unable to self-report his drug history due to persisting aphasia. The INR measured by a commercial POC device was within normal range (1.00; normal 0.85-1.18). IVT (rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg) was initiated 80 min after symptom onset and before all laboratory findings were received. Around 20 min after IVT had commenced, coagulation parameters were normal [including INR (1.10), thrombin time (18.8 s; normal 14-21), partial thromboplastin time (34.8 s, normal 23-36) and platelet counts]. A follow-up cCT ruled out IVT-induced ICH and the patient fully recovered within 48 h (NIHS score: 0). At this stage, he was able to report regular intake of apixaban (Eliquis¬Æ, 2.5 mg t.i.d.) since April 2014 due to atrial fibrillation. The last apixaban tablet had been taken 13.5 h before IVT.

 Here is the patient note:
A 46 year old male, a known hypertensive on treatment for the past 10 years, was diagnosed to have chronic renal failure 3 years ago. Consequently he progressed to ESRD and hemodialysis was initiated in December 2006 for the same, with the creation of a brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula over the left arm. He has been undergoing regular thrice weekly hemodialysis since then. He is a school teacher by occupation. He had no past history of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, or hepatic disease. No past history of Tuberculosis or TB contact. He is married and has two sons. He was a non-smoker and a non-alcoholic.
Over the past year, the artificial AV fistula enlarged in size to attain its current dimensions (Figure ). On 3rd June 2008, he presented to the emergency department of our tertiary care hospital with complaints of progressive breathlessness over the past 15 days. There was no history of associated chest pain, palpitations, syncope, cough, expectoration, or orthopnea.
On examination, he had pallor and bilateral pitting pedal edema. He was afebrile, with a pulse rate of 108/min, BP of 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28/min. A giant arteriovenous fistula was seen extending from the cubital fossa of the left arm up to the left supraclavicular region (Figure ). Respiratory system examination revealed stony dullness over the left mammary, infra-axillary and sub-scapular areas on percussion. On auscultation, there was decreased intensity of breath sounds over the above mentioned areas. Normal vesicular breath sounds were heard over all other areas. Other systems examination was unremarkable.
His blood investigations showed hemoglobin of 4.5 g/dl, BUN ‚Äì 13 mg/dl, creatinine- 2.6 mg/dl, with other parameters being within normal limits. His coagulation profile was slightly deranged with a raised INR (Table ). Chest X-ray revealed a massive pleural effusion on the left side (Figure ). USG guided pleural aspiration revealed a hemorrhagic fluid. Pleural fluid analysis showed no WBCs, RBC ‚Äì 5000/mm3 (normocytic 22%, crenated 88%), sugar ‚Äì 70 mgs/dl, protein ‚Äì 4.3 g/dl. Doppler study of the AV fistula showed a high peak velocity of 350 cms/sec, with no evidence of thrombosis or stenosis. In order to drain the hemorrhagic pleural effusion, an intercostal drain was placed. Patient was managed with 5 units packed red cell transfusion, oxygen and other supportive measures. With this presentation the possible cause for the left hemothorax was suspected to be due to the AV fistula. Hence after the patient was stabilized, the giant AV fistula was ligated on the 6th day after admission. Following ligation of the fistula, the patient's left sided pleural effusion decreased. The chest drain was removed after 7 days and patient was discharged after 3 more days. On follow up 6 weeks later, the patient did not have a recurrence of pleural effusion (Figure ). For further hemodialysis, the creation of a new fistula on his right arm has been planned.

 Here is the patient note:
We describe the case of a 70-year-old woman who developed sudden-onset vertical separation of images. This occurred only when she specifically gazed at a distance. For example, when she looked at a plant, she saw a double image that was completely vertically separated, without overlap. The bottom image was blurry and with color but of a similar size. It appeared ghostly and almost transparent. She could almost see through it; it was diaphanous. However, it did not disappear with either eye closed. The blurry second-bottom image disappeared only with the closure of both eyes or by looking away from the object. Hence, there was no evidence of palinopsia or bona fide diplopia. This phenomenon occurred for both stationary and moving objects. A moving truck was experienced as two vertically separated images, with the bottom image described as blurry. She knew that the bottom duplicated image was not real. The duplicated image was of the same size and receded as she approached it, as demonstrated by the patient's own original rendition (Figure ).
She denied any visual field loss or scotoma. The color perception was preserved. She denied photopsia, micropsia, macropsia, or metamorphopsia. Visual acuity was not diminished, and she was still able to read and write with ease. She denied a headache or weakness of the arms or legs. She saw an ophthalmologist who noted full ocular motion without any subtle ophthalmoparesis on double Maddox rod testing.
Her past medical history was significant for asthma and ulcerative colitis. Her medications included azathioprine, lansoprazole, mesalamine, and montelukast. Her mom had coronary artery disease and her dad had cerebrovascular disease. She was a non-smoker.
On examination, her blood pressure (BP) was 150/92 with a pulse of 71, which was regular. Her height is five feet with a weight of 185 pounds and a body mass index (BMI) of 36.1. The precordial examination was negative for a murmur and carotid bruits were absent in both internal carotid arteries. Her neurologic examination was non-revealing. Her gait station, cadence, and tandem walking were normal. Her cranial nerve examination was entirely normal. Specifically, the ocular motion was full without strabismus with a cover/uncover test and an alternate eye cover test. Accommodation was preserved without pupillary asymmetry, and visual field confrontation was normal. We were careful not to miss visual field neglect by sequential hemifield visual confrontation followed by simultaneous double hemifield confrontation. The rest of the cranial nerve function was normal. Visuomotor praxis was preserved with pantomime. No limb-kinetic or ideomotor apraxia was noted with coin deftness and transitive motor acts respectively. Ishihara plate color testing was normal. Power function was normal throughout and graded at 5/5 with the Medical Research Council (MRC) grading. Sensory examination was normal to graphesthesia and stereognosis in both hands. And deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and lively in the arms and legs. No dysmetria or intention tremor was noted in the arms. Heel to shin motion was normal in the legs bilaterally.
A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain shows a diffusion-weighted image (DWI) hyperintensity involving the left mesial occipital lobe; striate cortex, V1, spilling over into the adjacent visual association cortex, V2, indicating an ischemic infarct (Figure ).
There was a corresponding hypointensity on gradient echo imaging (GRE) in the region of V2 (Figure ).
A carotid duplex scan was normal. A transcranial Doppler (TCD) with a two Megahertz crystal with the insonation of temporal, transorbital, and sub-occipital windows bilaterally showed monophasic waveforms with no high-velocity jets, which was normal. Due to the embolic nature of the ischemic infarct and a normal event monitor, a cardiac loop monitor was implanted to rule out paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. A transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study did not reveal a patent foramen ovale or any evidence of cardiac vegetations or intra-cavitary thrombus. The automated Humphrey visual field test showed a subtle and patchy incongruous right homonymous hemianopia (Figure ); the patient herself did not notice any visual field deficits.
The patient was defaulted to 81 milligrams (mg) of aspirin daily.

 Here is the patient note:
A 10-year-old male patient was brought to our department with premature pubarche and onset of facial acne at the age of 8 years and increase in penis size at the age of 9 years. Concomitantly, he had a progressive, gradually worsening holocranial headache associated with drowsiness and loss of appetite. The patient denied deterioration of vision. Previously, he was a healthy patient, born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at term weighing 3510 g and measuring 50 cm. He was breastfed for 3 months and had normal neuropsychomotor development. The patient had no family history of endocrine disorders, sexual precocity, or consanguinity. The mother's and father's self-reported height was 155 cm and 175 cm respectively. Physical examination revealed height of 148 cm (90-95th percentile), weight of 39 kg (75-90th percentile), blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, heart rate of 60 beats per minute, facial acne, abdominal fat deposition in the periumbilical region, bilateral, symmetrical and prepubertal sized (3 mL) testes within the scrotum, 8-cm long penis, and Tanner stage P3-G2. Papilledema was detected on fundoscopy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a large, hyperintense tumor in the suprasellar region, with hypodense areas inside the tumor, which was located in the anterior third ventricle, measuring 3 cm in the largest diameter and causing triventricular dilatation []. Radiographs of the hands and wrists revealed significant acceleration of bone age (BA) in relation to chronological age (CA) (BA: 13 years; CA: 10 years and 8 months; standard deviation: 10 months). MRI of the abdomen yielded normal results. Laboratory tests revealed that the values for serum glucose, albumin, calcium, sodium, potassium, renal function, and liver function were within the normal limits. Hormonal tests showed increased hCG levels in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), increased total testosterone levels, and hypopituitarism (unresponsiveness to gonadorelin stimulation test) []. The results of tumor marker tests are also described in .
The patient was diagnosed with an hCG- and testosterone-producing tumor associated with hypopituitarism and intracranial hypertension. Hormone replacement therapy was initiated with levothyroxine and hydrocortisone, and transcranial surgery was performed. Anatomopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of germinoma []]. Radiotherapy was performed after surgical resection of the tumor. The patient showed complete regression of sexual characteristics and acne, with normal laboratory tests post-operatively.

 Here is the patient note:
An 82-year-old Japanese man was transferred to the emergency unit of Shimada Municipal Hospital, Shimada, Shizuoka, Japan, with complaints of severe watery diarrhea and hematochezia. The patient had suffered from hypertension and hyperlipidemia since the age of 50. He had undergone total hip replacement for right femoral head fracture caused by a traffic accident at the age of 71, and he received a surgical procedure for lumber spinal stenosis at the age of 74. Borderline diabetes mellitus with HbA1c levels ranging from 6.0% to 6.6% was pointed out since the age of 72, while the blood glucose level remained within a normal range. At the age of 76, the diagnosis of hypertensive and diabetic chronic kidney disease was made. The patient suffered from pneumonia when he was 78 years old. One year before admission, an infected cyst (abscess) around the right femoral prosthesis was indicated by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured, and the first and third-generation Cefem plus new quinolone were continuously administered. Three months before admission, continuous drainage from the infected lesion was conducted. No gastrointestinal complaints were recorded prior to the final admission.
His watery diarrhea was severe, more than 10 times a day, and hematochezia was associated. The body temperature was 37.5¬∞C, blood pressure 138/90 mm Hg, heart rate 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 96% while breathing ambient air. The body weight was 57.0 kg with a body mass index at 22.0. Systolic heart murmur was auscultated. The abdomen was soft with weak bowel sounds. There was tenderness of the whole abdomen on palpation, without guarding, rigidity, distention, or mass formation. Main results of laboratory tests on admission included the following: white blood cells 4400/ŒºL, hemoglobin 13.3 g/dL, platelets 305 000/ŒºL, Na 135 mmol/L, K 3.6 mmol/L, Cl 102 mmol/L, Ca 6.4 mg/dL, Pi 4.6 mg/dL, albumin 1.8 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 49.9 mg/dL, creatinine 5.3 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 26.1 mg/dL. The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with long PR and QT intervals. Deterioration of renal functions for the last 10-year period is illustrated in Figure . For the last 3 months, hemodialysis was needed.
Plain and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, performed on the first and eighth days of hospitalization, respectively, indicated significant ischemic changes of the sigmoid colon through the rectum with wall thickening of the sigmoid colon, ascites retention, bilateral pleural effusions, and mild renal atrophy. Colonofiberscopy indicated diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and ischemic changes and erosions of the stenotic sigmoid colon through rectum (Figure ). Microbiologically, the stool proved normal flora, and fecal Clostridium difficile toxin test and blood microbial culture were negative. The clinical diagnosis of ischemic and infectious colitis secondary to the long-term usage of antibiotics was made. Intravenous infusion of ceftriaxone for 5 days was chosen empirically because it is metabolized in the liver. However, it was ineffective for relieving diarrhea and colitis, and then meropenem was chosen for controlling the intractable colonic symptoms. Inflammation peaked out 14 days after the treatment, but soon, the inflammatory reaction and diarrhea re-exacerbated. The patient expired 26 days after admission. No free air was observed in the abdominal cavity on the contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan 3 days before death.
The autopsy was conducted 6 hours after death. In the sigmoid colon, fibrosing and adhesive diverticulitis with mucosal ischemic changes and erosions were grossly observed. Microscopically, eosinophilic hyaline material was deposited throughout the gut wall. The deposits were congophilic. Immunohistochemically, amyloid A, visualized by the monoclonal antibody mc-1 against serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), was identified in the lamina propria mucosae through the subserosa, including diverticular and vascular walls (Figure ). In the prepylorus of the stomach, a large perforating ulcer measuring 12 mm was found, and purulent peritonitis with turbid ascites was associated (Figure ). Candida infection was microscopically demonstrated on the involved mucosa and serosa at the site of gastric perforation (Figure ). Candida albicans were cultured from turbid ascitic fluid containing a total of 1150 mL. Candidal esophagitis was also noted. Deposition of amyloid A was evident in the gastric mucosa through the subserosa, and the amyloid deposition was especially prominent and seen in the full-thickness of the mucosa at the site of gastric perforation (Figure ). Amyloid A was also diffusely deposited in the wall of the esophagus through the rectum. Pleural effusion was associated (left: 150 mL, right: 300 mL).
Systemic congophilic deposition of amyloid A was further demonstrated in the tongue, salivary gland, thyroid gland, lung, heart, pancreas, splenic white pulp, adrenal glands, kidney, urinary bladder, and ureter. The deposition was especially pronounced in the thyroid gland (38 g) and urinary tract.
Atrophic kidneys weighed 72 g (left) and 73 g (right). Microscopically, amyloid A deposits caused amyloid glomerulopathy in association with vascular wall involvement. Features of diabetic glomerulosclerosis were indistinct because of marked amyloid deposition, while arteriolosclerosis was observed. Pancreatic islets focally showed diabetes-related localized hyaline (amyloid) deposition. Characteristically, co-deposition of amyloid A and IgM in the renal glomerulus was demonstrated by immunostaining using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections after prolonged protease-1 digestion (Figure ). IgG and IgA were undetectable. The co-deposition of amyloid A and IgM was scarcely observed in the systemic amyloid A deposits outside the kidney (Figure ).
Most of the hepatocytes were immunostained with the anti-SAA1 monoclonal antibody mc-1. Cytoplasmic granular positivity was evident. The acinar cells of the pancreas and salivary gland were also positively stained. These findings indicated accelerated production of SAA1 protein by these cells as a prolonged inflammatory response (Figure ).
Another incidental finding included aortic stenosis caused by dystrophic calcification in the cusps of the aortic valve. Left ventricular hypertrophy (heart weight 415 g) was caused by both aortic stenosis and amyloid deposition. The aorta revealed severe atherosclerosis. The abscess lesion around the right femoral prosthesis was not evaluated.

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old female patient with a known case of diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease due to hypertension was started on hemodialysis in March 2014. Permanent tunneled catheters were placed into the right internal jugular vein as the patient was not fit for AVF creation due to vascular occlusions.
On 7 April 2019, at the end of a dialysis session, the patient developed fever (39¬∞C) and chills. Fever was documented at 39¬∞C, was associated with chills and rigors, and was not responding to antipyretics. In the emergency department, the patient reported no change in weight, loss of appetite, or night sweats. She denied any history of respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological symptoms. On examination, the temperature was 39¬∞C, the blood pressure 150/75 mm Hg, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The patient was fully conscious and oriented. The remainder of the general medical examination was normal.
She was admitted to our nephrology unit with possible source catheter-related blood stream infection. She was started on ceftazidime 2 gm IV once daily and vancomycin 1 gm IV Q HD as per the protocol. The white blood cell count was 13.3 √ó 103 cells, C-reactive protein was 278 mg/dl, and procalcitonin was 52.27. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, and chest radiography was negative.
Blood culture from venous and central catheters was sampled separately, and the causative microorganism was identified as a Gram-negative, motile, lactose-fermenting bacillus, which was identified by the Vitek MS automatic identification system using a GN card as Leclercia adecarboxylata. Antibiotic sensitivity testing using Vitek 2 showed that it is an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer. The results are summarized in (). The L. adecarboxylata strain was resistant to most beta-lactams, including narrow, expanded, and broad-spectrum cephalosporins. But it was susceptible to all quinolones and carbapenems tested.
The treatment regimen was changed to meropenem 500 mg IV once daily and gentamicin based on antibiotic susceptibility tests (ASTs) from blood cultures. This targeted therapy was successful, and the patient became afebrile. The patient received meropenem and gentamicin for two weeks, and then she was discharged in good condition.

 Here is the patient note:
A 59-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with a carrot in the rectum and mild lower abdominal discomfort. He had no specific history and denied homosexual identity. The patient's blood pressure was 132/78 mm Hg; pulse rate, 88/min; respiration rate, 18/min; and body temperature, 36.5‚ÑÉ. Abdominal examination revealed a soft and flat abdomen with normal bowel sounds. Digital rectal examination revealed the hard bottom of the carrot near the rectal angle and normal anal sphincter tone. His laboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin level, 14.7 g/dL; white blood cell count, 17,270/mm3; and CRP level, 6.55 mg/L. The results of evaluations for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and HIV antibody were all negative. The foreign body was not observed on abdominal radiography, and no evidence of peritoneal or perirectal free air was observed ().
The carrot observed during endoscopy was deemed to be too large and heavy for removal using endoscopic devices. Hence, we decided to use tenaculum forceps from the start. By using the same techniques described previously, we were able to remove the carrot successfully (). The patient's abdominal discomfort subsided immediately, and he was discharged from the hospital.

 Here is the patient note:
A 34-year-old Surinamese female was referred to the Department of Vascular Medicine of our hospital because of right-sided blurred vision, caused by ischemic retinopathy and neovascularisation (Fig. ). Her medical history was remarkable for heterozygote alpha-thalassemia, but negative for thrombotic and recurrent infectious events. The family history was also negative for thrombotic events or bleeding tendency. The patient was not treated with anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors. Physical examination was normal (BMI 23.0 kg/m2, blood pressure 125/70 mmHg, heart rate 85/min, normal heart sounds, and no vascular murmurs). After the exclusion of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, hyperviscosity, and sickle cell disease, a thrombophilia workup was performed. All hemostatic laboratory parameters were found normal except for an increased protein S activity (179%) with high free protein S level (207%), despite a normal total protein S antigen level (98%) (Table ). This suggested that, in contrast to normal conditions, all protein S was free protein S, instead of 30‚Äì40% free and 60‚Äì70% bound protein S. High activity and antigen levels of free protein S were confirmed in a separate sample 3 months later. Clinically, a protein S deficiency is considered as a possible cause of hypercoagulation, which in turn could have led to the retinopathy. The incidental finding of elevated protein S levels were not considered explanatory of the condition. We did not initiate anticoagulation or thrombocyte aggregation inhibition. The patient's vision did not improve remarkably, nor did it deteriorate in the subsequent months after her initial visit.
The high free protein S level in the proband was caused by a reduced level of C4BP (18%), as measured with an ELISA against the Œ±-chain of C4BP. To identify a possible molecular defect underlying the C4BP deficiency, we sequenced the protein-coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of C4BPA (encoding C4BPŒ±, ) and C4BPB (encoding C4BPŒ≤, ).
We identified two previously reported non-synonymous variants in C4BPA, that is, c.719G>A (p.R240H), rs45574833 ((A=0.0140/1686 (ExAC), A = 0.0030/15 (1000 Genomes), A = 0.0095/124 (GO-ESP), A = 0.0078/227 (TOPMED)), and c.899T>C (p.I300T), rs4844573 (C = 0.4014/47780 [ExAC], C = 0.4898/2453 [1000 Genomes], C = 0.4841/6296 [GO-ESP], T = 0.4689/13653 [TOPMED]).
In addition, we screened the father and brother for these mutations. Both are also Surinamese. Only p.I300T was present in the father (Fig. ). Both father and brother had normal free protein S levels. Mother, second sister, and second brother were unavailable for testing.
Discordant data concerning the association between C4BP polymorphisms and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported , . Furthermore, these two variants have also been identified in women experiencing recurrent miscarriages, but due to equally high frequencies between patients and controls, the importance of these variants in this particular clinical situation may be questionable . No mutations were found in the C4BPB gene.
Because we could not find clear molecular defect in the C4BP gene responsible for the reduced expression, and a recent report indicated that binding of protein S to C4BP promotes cellular secretion of C4BP , we also sequenced the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-like region of protein S (), responsible for binding to C4BP using the previously published primers , . No mutations explaining a reduced binding of protein S to C4BP were found in the SHBG-domain of protein S.
Although the medical records did not report any use of vitamin K antagonist, we excluded the interference of any form of vitamin K antagonists by the measurement of coagulation factors II, VII, and X which were all normal, except for factor X which was slightly increased (163%) (Table ). Furthermore, there was no indication of reduced capacity of liver synthesis with normal antithrombin and factor V levels. Furthermore, we also did not find a clear effect of decreased C4BP levels on the complement route, with normal complement pathway activities (Table ).

 Here is the patient note:
A 21-year-old man presented to our emergency room with a complaint of right lower abdominal pain for 2 days. On physical examination, the vital signs were as follows: temperature, 37.3¬∞C; heart rate, 94/min; respiratory rate, 20/min; blood pressure, 120/75 mm Hg. The abdominal examination was significant for tenderness and pain in the right lower quadrant upon palpation. There was no rebound tenderness or muscle rigidity. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed the following: white blood cell count, 9.54 √ó 109/L; neutrophilic granulocytes, 81.1%; hemoglobin, 136 g/L; platelet count, 232 √ó 109/L. Kidney function and other biochemical measures were normal. Computed tomography (CT, Figure A and B) showed pneumatosis in the appendix and fluid in the pelvic cavity. Based on the above findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made and a laparoscopic appendectomy was undertaken; however, the appendix was normal in appearance and an appendectomy was not performed. Intraoperatively, the terminal ileum was noted to be approximately 15 cm in diameter, hyperemic, and edematous (Figure ); there was no apparent inflammation of the appendix. Thus, terminal ileitis was diagnosed. Three days postoperatively, the patient had rose-colored petechiae and palpable purpura on the lower extremities, and HSP was diagnosed. Subsequently, methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/d iv) was administered for 5 days. Seven days postoperatively, the abdominal pain and purpura resolved. There were no recurrences in the subsequent 8 months, and long-term follow-up in the clinic was recommended.

 Here is the patient note:
A 72-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with dyspnea and myalgia that developed 2 weeks after undergoing acupuncture therapy on both knees due to arthralgia. Vital signs on admission showed hypotension (80/40 mm Hg), tachycardia (118 beats per minute), tachypnea (20 per minute), and hypothermia (35‚ÑÉ). On physical examination, the patient had multiple needle scars on both knees with dappled rashes on her entire body (). Her laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell counts (10100/mm3), with neutrophil 88%, elevated high sensitive C-reactive protein level of 36 mg/dL (reference range, 0-0.5 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 71/4.5 mg/dL, myoglobin 5169 ng/mL (reference range, 16.3-96.5 ng/dL), creatine kinase myocardial band 9.7 U/L (reference range, 0-3.6 U/L), Troponin I 0.28 ng/mL (re-ference range, 0-0.1 ng/mL). A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and an electrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with fluid collection in the posterolateral wall of the pericardium with no evidence of valvular vegetation or tamponade physiology (). Pericardial aspiration of the fluid revealed a bloody material () and cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. Blood cultures showed staphylococcal bacteremia (). Lab analysis of aspiration fluid showed elevated white blood cell counts >50000/mm3), with polymorph-onuclear neutrophil 90%, pH 7.3, glucose 5 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 12397 U/L, albumin 2.4 g/dL and total protein 6.2 g/dL. Percutaneous drainage and empiric antibiotic treatment were started immediately. However, the patient expired due to refractory sepsis and organ failure.
