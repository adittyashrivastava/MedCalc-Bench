 Here is the patient note:
An 87-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for anorexia for several days, high-grade fever from the previous day, and liver dysfunction. Of note, he had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and angina. Physical examination findings included: clear consciousness; height, 163 cm; weight, 48 kg; blood pressure, 66/40 mmHg; heart rate, 75/min; respiratory rate, 22/min; oxygen saturation of peripheral artery, 96%; and body temperature, 38.1 °C. He had no surface lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings included: white blood cell (WBC) count, 4.2 × 109/L; hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL; platelet count, 106 × 109/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 1662 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 6562 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1407 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 509 IU/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), 130 IU/L; total bilirubin, 2.7 mg/dL; prothrombin time (PT), 20.3 s; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.73; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 34.4 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.4 mg/dL. Serologic tests were all negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Computed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed no distinct nodules or masses in the liver, but mild splenomegaly, multiple hypodense splenic lesions, and para-aortic lymph node swelling (Fig. a–c). Antibiotics were administered intravenously for suspected acute cholangitis and sepsis, but the fever persisted. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 2 days later newly depicted gallbladder wall thickening and ascites (Figs. , ). On the same night, the patient presented with grade II hepatic encephalopathy, with blood tests showing a decrease in platelet count and worsening liver function suggestive of “acute type” ALF with hepatic coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While consideration was being given to treating acute liver failure, the patient suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation and died despite immediate resuscitation measures on day 3 of hospitalization.
Given the rapid clinical course, an autopsy was performed in this patient with suspected ALF likely due to drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis of indeterminate etiology, circulatory disturbance, metabolic disease, or malignant cells including malignant lymphoma. This led to the patient being diagnosed with malignant, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterized by multiple lymph-node, as well as multi-organ (i.e., spleen, liver, lung, and prostate) involvement: (1) general swelling of lymph nodes in the para-abdominal aorta (Fig. a), peripancreatic, peribronchial, pulmonary hilar, subclavicular regions, as well as in the pelvis, especially around the iliac arteries, measuring up to 60 mm in diameter; (2) presence of multiple whitish splenic nodules (Fig. b) with the entire spleen shown to be microscopically infiltrated by tumor cells (Fig. a); (3) irregular geographical morphology of the liver (Fig. c) with the lymphoma cells mainly infiltrating the portal areas (Fig. b); (4) involvement of the right lobe of the lung; (5) involvement of both lobes of the prostate consequent to outer connective tissue involvement (Fig. c). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the lymph nodes were shown to have medium-sized irregular nuclei and small nucleoli with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, thus showing diffuse proliferation characterized by the presence of large numbers of small T-cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD20 (Fig. a), CD79a (Fig. b), bcl-2 (Fig. c), and MUM1 (Fig. d), but negative for CD3 (Fig. e), CD10, bcl-6, and cyclin D1, with a Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) of 16% (Fig. f). The causes of death were thus determined as (1) DIC and (2) ALF associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not mentioned in the note, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight for a 163 cm tall male is approximately 54 kg. Since the patient's actual weight is 48 kg, we will set the adjusted body weight to 48 kg. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The equation is: CrCl = (140 - age) x weight in kg / (72 x creatinine in mg/dL). Plugging in the values, we get: CrCl = (140 - 87) x 48 / (72 x 1.4) = 34.4 mL/min.

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old man with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency room shortly before midnight with sharp chest pain, nausea, and dyspnea. The patient states he has had chest discomfort and food intolerance for the past week, but that his symptoms were far worse tonight. He notes no inciting event, recent trauma, or aggravating factors. On exam he appears uncomfortable, anxious, and is in a semi-tripod position. Vitals are pertinent for a heart rate of 144, systolic blood pressure in the 180 s, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 1L O2 via nasal cannula. Of note, the patient weighed 67.2 kg, and was 173 cm tall. Chart review showed that he had lost approximately 4 kg (last recorded weight in chart was 71.2 kg), since his last medical visit.
Primary survey was overall unremarkable. Airway was secure, patient’s breathing improved with 3 L oxygen, breath sounds were present and equal bilaterally, vascular access was obtained, and GCS was 15. Intravenous pain medication was given which improved the patient’s blood pressure to systolic 140 s. Given this patient’s overall clinical picture, the most pressing disease processes included myocardial infarction (given history of coronary artery disease and prior infarcts), aortic dissection (given symptoms, hypertension, and medical history), pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (the previous two diagnoses given his chest pain and decreased O2 even on 1 L of oxygen), and cardiac wall rupture (given multiple prior MIs). Other considerations include congestive heart failure, hypertensive crisis, and an underlying infection.
Labs were drawn to include a CBC, renal panel, cardiac panel, lactate, and a type and cross. EKG was unremarkable. A chest X-ray was obtained which revealed a widened mediastinum (Fig. ).
The patient was stabilized, but the underlying cause of his symptoms had not yet been identified. His widened mediastinum is troubling, and further drives the differential. Aortic (dissection, aneurysm), cardiac (tamponade, wall rupture), and esophageal pathology (rupture versus other masses) now move to the top of the list of diagnoses. Labs continued to be pending. Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ).
Along with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL. Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia. Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals. Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus. No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported.
The findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient. Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient. The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects. The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter. In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal.
On EGD, the patient’s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter. The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it. The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient’s lab derangements (Fig. ).
The decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device. About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL). A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning. Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus. In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage). He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit.
The patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night. The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition. The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan. The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity. An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization.
The patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor. During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization. He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ). After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis. Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient’s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning). He was followed up in the outpatient setting for further management.

Intravenous pain medication was given which improved the patient’s blood pressure to systolic 140 s. Given this patient’s overall clinical picture, the most pressing disease processes included myocardial infarction (given history of coronary artery disease and prior infarcts), aortic dissection (given symptoms, hypertension, and medical history), pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (the previous two diagnoses given his chest pain and decreased O2 even on 1 L of oxygen), and cardiac wall rupture (given multiple prior MIs). Other considerations include congestive heart failure, hypertensive crisis, and an underlying infection. Labs were drawn to include a CBC, renal panel, cardiac panel, lactate, and a type and cross. EKG was unremarkable. A chest X-ray was obtained which revealed a widened mediastinum (Fig. ). The patient was stabilized, but the underlying cause of his symptoms had not yet been identified. His widened mediastinum is troubling, and further drives the differential. Aortic (dissection, aneurysm), cardiac (tamponade, wall rupture), and esophageal pathology (rupture versus other masses) now move to the top of the list of diagnoses. Labs continued to be pending. Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ). Along with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL. Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia. Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals. Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus. No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported. The findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient. Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient. The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects. The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter. In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal. On EGD, the patient’s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter. The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it. The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient’s lab derangements (Fig. ). The decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device. About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL). A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning. Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus. In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage). He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit. The patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night. The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition. The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan. The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity. An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization. The patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor. During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization. He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ). After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis. Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient’s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning). He was followed up in the outpatient setting for further management. Here is the task: What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not mentioned in the note, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight for a 173 cm tall male is approximately 62 kg. Since the patient's actual weight is 67.2 kg, we will set the adjusted body weight to 62 kg. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance. The equation is: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = (140 - age) x weight (kg) / (72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)). We are given the patient's age, weight, and serum creatinine. We will plug in the values and solve for Creatinine Clearance.

 Here is the patient note:
A 51-year-old woman who presented with diarrhoea containing mucus and blood had initially been diagnosed with acute severe ulcerative pan-colitis and backwash ileitis at the age of 49 years at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) in December 2014. She had poliomyelitis when she was very young, and there was nothing special regarding her family or psychosocial history. Serology was positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and negative for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA). Her condition was refractory to steroids and complicated by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Ultimately, she underwent sub-total colectomy and ileostomy in February 2015. Pathological examination of the resection specimen showed diffuse pan-colitis consistent with UC and no indications of Crohn’s disease (Fig. ). She did well in the following 11 months; prednisone was tapered and stopped within 2 months, and she gained 5 kg of weight after the ileostomy. In January 2016, a scheduled restorative ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with proximal neo-ileostomy was performed.
From one month after the IPAA, her 24-h stool collection slowly increased to 1.5–2 L. Next, she noticed decreased urine output since April. In early May 2016, she presented to our emergency room with repeated unconsciousness over the course of 10 days. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 74/50 mmHg; heart rate (HR), 90 bpm; additionally, she exhibited a poor nutritional status (160 cm; 39 kg). On physical examination, active bowel sounds were noticed to occur approximately 7–9 times per minute. Her serum creatinine level was 183 μmol/L, indicating acute kidney injury. Treatment with fluid replacement and noradrenaline maintained her BP at 80–90/50–60 mmHg and gradually normalized her creatinine level. However, her 24-h watery stool collection persisted, and she developed fever and vomiting. While many leukocytes were found in stool collected from the diverted ileostomy, repeated stool cultures and tests for Clostridium difficile toxins were negative. Tests for CMV-DNA, CMV-pp65 and EBV-DNA were performed and were all negative. The patient was not on any medications, including NSAIDs, upon verification. Her treatment with steroids was stopped before the end of April 2015. Empirical treatment with antibiotics, including ceftazidime, metronidazole and oral vancomycin, was administered with no response. Due to her reliance on noradrenaline, relative adrenal insufficiency was suspected, and hydrocortisone was initiated at 50 mg q6 h intravenously. Her stool volume decreased to less than 500 ml per day quickly, by which time the treatment with noradrenaline was successfully stopped. The levels of D-lactate, endotoxin and diamine oxidase indicated that the barrier function of the intestine was compromised and that bacterial translocation may have occurred. Oedematous inflamed mucosa with patchy superficial ulcers was observed in the diverted pouch by pouchoscopy. Although an upper endoscopy and an endoscopy through a stoma revealed a normal gross appearance in the stomach, duodenum and pre-stomal ileum (Fig. a, b), the histological examination of tissue biopsies of both the duodenum and pre-stomal ileum revealed enteritis, as indicated by moderate villous atrophy, cryptitis, decreased goblet cells, and severe active inflammation with neutrophil infiltration in the lamina propria, as well as negativity for intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Fig. a-d). From these lines of evidence of histological enteritis presenting in the duodenum, pre-stomal ileum and diverted pouch, we considered pan-enteritis to be present, and we diagnosed the patient with post-colectomy enteritis. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone at 30 mg intravenously once a day with tapering by 5 mg every 7 to 10 days; however, her stool volume from the ileostomy still gradually increased to 3–4 L. After a multidisciplinary team discussion, ileostomy closure was debated as the final rescue treatment and was performed in August 2016. Two months later, her stool volume decreased to less than 1 L per day, and she gained 2.5 kg of weight. Azathioprine at 50 mg/d was prescribed during the tapering of prednisone. Until the last follow-up in March 2018, she performed well, with an increase in body weight to 50 kg, and daily defecation approximately 5–6 times at less than 1 L/day, sometimes with form (Additional file ). Gastroduodenal endoscopy and pouchoscopy were repeated annually and showed normal villi in the descending duodenum and neo-ileum in March 2018 (Fig. c, d). Gradually, the histology changed, showing recovery of the villous atrophy, cryptitis and inflammation in the lamina propria to normal (Fig. e-f).

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not mentioned in the note, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight for a 51-year-old woman is approximately 50 kg. Since the patient's actual weight is 39 kg, we will set the adjusted body weight to 39 kg. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance. The equation is: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = (140 - age) x weight (kg) / (72 x serum creatinine level (μmol/L)). We will plug in the values: 140 - 51 = 89, 89 x 39 / (72 x 183) = 4.45 mL/min.
{'Row Number': 3, 'Calculator Name': 'Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)', 'Calculator ID': '2', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-6482549-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 51-year-old woman who presented with diarrhoea containing mucus and blood had initially been diagnosed with acute severe ulcerative pan-colitis and backwash ileitis at the age of 49 years at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) in December 2014. She had poliomyelitis when she was very young, and there was nothing special regarding her family or psychosocial history. Serology was positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and negative for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA). Her condition was refractory to steroids and complicated by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Ultimately, she underwent sub-total colectomy and ileostomy in February 2015. Pathological examination of the resection specimen showed diffuse pan-colitis consistent with UC and no indications of Crohn’s disease (Fig. ). She did well in the following 11 months; prednisone was tapered and stopped within 2 months, and she gained 5 kg of weight after the ileostomy. In January 2016, a scheduled restorative ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with proximal neo-ileostomy was performed.\nFrom one month after the IPAA, her 24-h stool collection slowly increased to 1.5–2 L. Next, she noticed decreased urine output since April. In early May 2016, she presented to our emergency room with repeated unconsciousness over the course of 10 days. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 74/50 mmHg; heart rate (HR), 90 bpm; additionally, she exhibited a poor nutritional status (160 cm; 39 kg). On physical examination, active bowel sounds were noticed to occur approximately 7–9 times per minute. Her serum creatinine level was 183 μmol/L, indicating acute kidney injury. Treatment with fluid replacement and noradrenaline maintained her BP at 80–90/50–60 mmHg and gradually normalized her creatinine level. However, her 24-h watery stool collection persisted, and she developed fever and vomiting. While many leukocytes were found in stool collected from the diverted ileostomy, repeated stool cultures and tests for Clostridium difficile toxins were negative. Tests for CMV-DNA, CMV-pp65 and EBV-DNA were performed and were all negative. The patient was not on any medications, including NSAIDs, upon verification. Her treatment with steroids was stopped before the end of April 2015. Empirical treatment with antibiotics, including ceftazidime, metronidazole and oral vancomycin, was administered with no response. Due to her reliance on noradrenaline, relative adrenal insufficiency was suspected, and hydrocortisone was initiated at 50 mg q6 h intravenously. Her stool volume decreased to less than 500 ml per day quickly, by which time the treatment with noradrenaline was successfully stopped. The levels of D-lactate, endotoxin and diamine oxidase indicated that the barrier function of the intestine was compromised and that bacterial translocation may have occurred. Oedematous inflamed mucosa with patchy superficial ulcers was observed in the diverted pouch by pouchoscopy. Although an upper endoscopy and an endoscopy through a stoma revealed a normal gross appearance in the stomach, duodenum and pre-stomal ileum (Fig. a, b), the histological examination of tissue biopsies of both the duodenum and pre-stomal ileum revealed enteritis, as indicated by moderate villous atrophy, cryptitis, decreased goblet cells, and severe active inflammation with neutrophil infiltration in the lamina propria, as well as negativity for intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Fig. a-d). From these lines of evidence of histological enteritis presenting in the duodenum, pre-stomal ileum and diverted pouch, we considered pan-enteritis to be present, and we diagnosed the patient with post-colectomy enteritis. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone at 30 mg intravenously once a day with tapering by 5 mg every 7 to 10 days; however, her stool volume from the ileostomy still gradually increased to 3–4 L. After a multidisciplinary team discussion, ileostomy closure was debated as the final rescue treatment and was performed in August 2016. Two months later, her stool volume decreased to less than 1 L per day, and she gained 2.5 kg of weight. Azathioprine at 50 mg/d was prescribed during the tapering of prednisone. Until the last follow-up in March 2018, she performed well, with an increase in body weight to 50 kg, and daily defecation approximately 5–6 times at less than 1 L/day, sometimes with form (Additional file ).

The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.\nThe patient is 51 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 183.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 183.0 µmol. To convert 183.0 µmol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 183.0 µmol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000183 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000183 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.021 g creatinine. To convert 0.021 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.021 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 21.0 mg creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 21.0 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 2.1 mg creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 183.0 µmol creatinine/L converts to 2.1 mg creatinine/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 160.0 cm, which is 160.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.6 m. The patient's weight is 50.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 50.0 kg / (1.6 m * 1.6 m) = 19.531 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 19.5, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 50.0 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 51) * 50.0 * 0.85) / (2.1 * 72) = 25.017 mL/min.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old, 58 kg, 156 cm woman presented with increased and prolonged vaginal bleedings. A physical examination and an ultrasound showed a submucosal leiomyoma of the uterus. There were no other symptoms or pathological findings. Preoperative blood tests, which included electrolytes analyses, a full blood exam, and coagulation parameters, showed no anomalies. Most notably, both creatinine and sodium were within normal levels, i.e. 0.7 mg/dL and 137 mEq/L, respectively. The patient had a history of encephalopathy during childhood of an unknown origin without sequelae, an elective caesarean section (1997) due to leiomyoma, laparoscopic myomectomy and removal of an endometrial cyst of the ovary (1999), and a second caesarean section (2000) due to an uterine instability subsequent to the first caesarean section and myomectomy. The patient had no known allergies. She was taking daily doses of ethinyl estradiol (0.02 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.1 mg) continuously over a period of six months. The patient refused a hysterectomy but an endoscopic removal of the leiomyoma and an endometrial ablation was decided on, subsequent to which the patient gave written informed consent. The patient was administered with 7.5 mg midazolam orally 60 min preoperatively. Subsequent to placing the patient in the lithotomy position, the application of a peripheral venous catheter and the attachment of standard monitoring equipment (electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure cuff and a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation analyzer), anaesthesia was induced intravenously with propofol (2 mg/kg) and sufentanil (0.3 μg/kg).
A laryngeal mask was inserted, and after the correct positioning was verified, the lungs were ventilated with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 and a minute volume (MV) of 74 mL/min/kg at a ventilation frequency of 10/min in volume controlled mode (IPPV). The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level was 0 Pa and the peak pressure was 900 Pa. Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol (8 mg/kg/h). After anaesthesiological clearance the endoscopy commenced. Purisole® SM (Fresenius Kabi Inc., Germany) was utilized as the distension medium. This standard hypotonic solution contains 27 g sorbitol and 5.4 g mannitol per liter. A pressure of 16 kPa (120 mmHg) was applied to unfold the uterine cavity. Endometrial ablation and dissection of the submucosal myoma were performed within 70 min by monopolar resection. The duration of the procedure was prolonged due to the reduced visibility caused by excessive bleeding and cervical leakage of distension medium, which impeded proper expansion of the uterine cavity. The ventilation pressure increased slowly and continuously 60 min subsequent to the start of surgery. The compliance of the lungs, as well as the achievable minute volume within the acceptable airway pressure limit of 2 kPa, decreased. It was presumed that the level of anaesthesia was insufficient and was followed by the increased administration of propofol (10 mg/kg/h). The additional inhalation of fenoterol did, however, not improve the situation. As ventilation continued to be difficult, the laryngeal mask was replaced by a 7.0 cm (inside diameter) cuffed tube subsequent to the administration of 100 mg succinylcholine as a muscle relaxant. Approximately 50 mL of a foamy, transparent liquid was aspirated from the trachea. Testing with litmus paper indicated an alkaline pH and, therefore, not the aspiration of gastric content. The amount of the pulmonary oedema increased and, despite high levels of peak airway pressures at this point approximately 3 kPa (= set peak pressure limit), adequate ventilation was not possible. Blood gas and electrolyte analyses indicated acidosis, as well as a severe hyponatremia (pH 7.11; Na 74 mEq/L; partial pressure of CO2 49.9 mmHg; saturation of O2 97 % at FiO2 1.0). Cardiopulmonary changes remained minimal. 40 mg of furosemide and 500 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were immediately administered at an infusion rate of 500 mL/h, with constant monitoring for electrolyte changes. As the patient showed clinical signs of impaired haemostasis, the operation procedure was stopped. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with continuous administration of 3 % NaCl at a rate of 50 mL/h and electrolyte control. Plasma sodium levels increased from 74 mEq/L to 103 mEq/L after one hour, and to 130 mEq/L after 7 h (Fig. ). All together 800 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were administered within 7 h totalling at 24 g. Subsequently, sodium replenishment was stopped and the patient was extubated without problems. Immediate neurological assessment revealed no detectable deficits. 20 h after the onset of hyponatremia, the patient’s sodium levels returned to within the normal range. Until then, the cumulative renal excretion was 8.5 L. 9 L of distension medium was used intraoperatively with a calculated uptake of 5 L. The patient was relocated to the gynaecologic ward the following day and was released from the hospital on the third postoperative day without any detectable sequelae.

First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not mentioned in the note, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight for a 45-year-old woman is approximately 52 kg. Since the patient's actual weight is 58 kg, we will use the actual weight as the adjusted body weight. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The equation is: Clcr = (140 - age) x weight in kg / (72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL). We are given the patient's age, weight, and serum creatinine level. We will plug in these values and solve for Clcr.

 Here is the patient note:
A 41-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with liver damage, itchy skin, and pyrexia. His medical history was unremarkable, but one year previously his gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels had risen to 271 IU/L (normal: < 30 IU/L). Prior to this, the patient had consumed 540 mL of sake three times a week, and he had been reducing the amount of alcohol he consumed for about one year. He did not smoke or take any recreational drugs. He was single, was not homosexual, and he had not had sexual intercourse for over one year.
The patient had undergone treatment of his internal hemorrhoids as an outpatient at a nearby hospital that comprised an aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) injection. He developed a fever of 38 °C, dark colored urine, and itchy skin on postoperative day (POD) 1, and he took loxoprofen sodium, as required. He consulted another doctor on POD 7, because the symptoms had not improved, and his blood test results led to a diagnosis of liver dysfunction. His liver dysfunction had not improved by POD 14, and he was admitted to our hospital on POD 15.
The patient was 167 cm tall and weighed 52.5 kg. He presented with a blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.6 °C, and 99% oxygen saturation in room air. No specific physical findings were evident during the clinical examination on the day of hospitalization, but the patient had a rash, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice. The subjective symptoms, comprising the fever, dark colored urine, and itchy skin, had disappeared by POD 10.
The laboratory test results showed that the patient’s complete blood count was almost normal with a white blood cell count of 6900 cells/μL, a hemoglobin concentration of 14.7 g/dL, a hematocrit level of 43.1%, and a platelet count of 3.98 × 105 cells/μL, but a higher percentage of eosinophils was present (6.8%) (normal: 1.0%-5.0%), which peaked at 13.9% on POD 20. The patient’s serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were elevated at the time of admission. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 432 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 911 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was 473 IU/L (normal: 115-359 IU/L), and the total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL). Thus, compared with the ALP level, the AST and ALT levels showed greater magnitudes of elevation. The patient’s other blood test results were within the normal ranges, as follows: serum albumin: 4.0 g/dL (normal: 3.8-5.2 g/dL); serum creatinine: 0.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.65-1.09 mg/dL); C-reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL (normal: 0-0.3 mg/dL); prothrombin time: 100% (normal: 80%-120 %); thyroid-stimulating hormone: 0.5 μIU/mL (normal: 0.34-4.04 μIU/mL); triiodothyronine: 2.98 pg/dL (normal: 2.36-5.00 pg/dL); and thyroxin: 1.18 ng/dL (normal: 0.88-1.67 ng/dL). The serological tests for autoantibodies generated weakly positive results (1:40) for anti-nuclear antibodies, and negative results for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Negative results were obtained from the tests for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the hepatitis C virus antibody, rapid plasma reagin, the anti-Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and the anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, and from the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test. The IgG level was within the normal range at 1415 mg/dL (normal: 800-1600 mg/dL) and the IgM level was within the normal range at 100 mg/dL (normal: 60-250 mg/dL). The IgE level was elevated at 1333 mg/dL (normal: < 250 mg/dL). Chest radiography did not reveal any abnormalities. No morphological changes were evident following abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and abdominal computed tomography (Figure ).
When the patient was hospitalized, we considered viral, alcohol-induced, autoimmune, drug-induced, biliary tract, and thyroid function-based diseases as frequent causes of acute liver dysfunction for the differential diagnosis, and, based on the patient’s medical history, and the serological and imaging results, we considered that alcohol and DILI were highly likely causes of the patient’s acute liver dysfunction. However, the patient had stopped drinking during the past year, so we thought that there was a high likelihood of DILI. Therefore, we began conservative treatment with a small amount of extracellular fluid replacement.
Figure presents the patient’s symptoms, laboratory test results, and treatment over the entire course. The liver transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased rapidly after admission, and the maximum levels were as follows: ALT: 950 IU/L on POD 15; AST: 470 IU/L on POD 17; and total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL on POD 17. The ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed consistent downward trends from POD 7. The patient's symptoms disappeared on POD 10, and no new symptoms appeared after hospitalization. We performed a liver biopsy on POD 25, and a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) of the components of the ALTA injection and lidocaine on POD 28. The patient was discharged on POD 29, and he was managed as an outpatient without any prescriptions. At the time of the patient’s first outpatient appointment on POD 35, his liver transaminase and bilirubin levels had declined and were almost within the normal ranges.
Figure presents hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of the liver biopsy performed on POD 25. The H and E staining showed that the basic structure of the liver had been maintained without any hepatocyte dropout or disruption, and that the bile duct had not been disrupted. At a higher magnification, the H and E staining showed that the parenchymal cells were partially dilated and that a mild inflammatory cell infiltration was present in the area of the central vein. Neither eosinophil nor plasma cell infiltrations were detected within the liver tissue. Bile plugs were found at multiple sites within the parenchyma and sinusoids. Masson staining did not show the presence of liver tissue fibrosis.
The lymphocyte proliferation activity levels, which were determined from the DLST performed on POD 28, were 676 counts per minute (cpm) for the control and 871 cpm for the ALTA with lidocaine. The stimulation index, which was calculated as the ALTA with lidocaine cpm divided by the control cpm, was 1.29 (normal in Japanese people: < 1.8).

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

His liver dysfunction had not improved by POD 14, and he was admitted to our hospital on POD 15. The patient was 167 cm tall and weighed 52.5 kg. He presented with a blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.6 °C, and 99% oxygen saturation in room air. No specific physical findings were evident during the clinical examination on the day of hospitalization, but the patient had a rash, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice. The subjective symptoms, comprising the fever, dark colored urine, and itchy skin, had disappeared by POD 10. The laboratory test results showed that the patient’s complete blood count was almost normal with a white blood cell count of 6900 cells/μL, a hemoglobin concentration of 14.7 g/dL, a hematocrit level of 43.1%, and a platelet count of 3.98 × 105 cells/μL, but a higher percentage of eosinophils was present (6.8%) (normal: 1.0%-5.0%), which peaked at 13.9% on POD 20. The patient’s serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were elevated at the time of admission. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 432 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 911 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was 473 IU/L (normal: 115-359 IU/L), and the total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL). Thus, compared with the ALP level, the AST and ALT levels showed greater magnitudes of elevation. The patient’s other blood test results were within the normal ranges, as follows: serum albumin: 4.0 g/dL (normal: 3.8-5.2 g/dL); serum creatinine: 0.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.65-1.09 mg/dL); C-reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL (normal: 0-0.3 mg/dL); prothrombin time: 100% (normal: 80%-120 %); thyroid-stimulating hormone: 0.5 μIU/mL (normal: 0.34-4.04 μIU/mL); triiodothyronine: 2.98 pg/dL (normal: 2.36-5.00 pg/dL); and thyroxin: 1.18 ng/dL (normal: 0.88-1.67 ng/dL). The serological tests for autoantibodies generated weakly positive results (1:40) for anti-nuclear antibodies, and negative results for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Negative results were obtained from the tests for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the hepatitis C virus antibody, rapid plasma reagin, the anti-Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and the anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, and from the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test. The IgG level was within the normal range at 1415 mg/dL (normal: 800-1600 mg/dL) and the IgM level was within the normal range at 100 mg/dL (normal: 60-250 mg/dL). The IgE level was elevated at 1333 mg/dL (normal: < 250 mg/dL). Chest radiography did not reveal any abnormalities. No morphological changes were evident following abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and abdominal computed tomography (Figure ). When the patient was hospitalized, we considered viral, alcohol-induced, autoimmune, drug-induced, biliary tract, and thyroid function-based diseases as frequent causes of acute liver dysfunction for the differential diagnosis, and, based on the patient’s medical history, and the serological and imaging results, we considered that alcohol and DILI were highly likely causes of the patient’s acute liver dysfunction. However, the patient had stopped drinking during the past year, so we thought that there was a high likelihood of DILI. Therefore, we began conservative treatment with a small amount of extracellular fluid replacement. Figure presents the patient’s symptoms, laboratory test results, and treatment over the entire course. The liver transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased rapidly after admission, and the maximum levels were as follows: ALT: 950 IU/L on POD 15; AST: 470 IU/L on POD 17; and total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL on POD 17. The ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed consistent downward trends from POD 7. The patient's symptoms disappeared on POD 10, and no new symptoms appeared after hospitalization. We performed a liver biopsy on POD 25, and a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) of the components of the ALTA injection and lidocaine on POD 28. The patient was discharged on POD 29, and he was managed as an outpatient without any prescriptions. At the time of the patient’s first outpatient appointment on POD 35, his liver transaminase and bilirubin levels had declined and were almost within the normal ranges. Figure presents hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of the liver biopsy performed on POD 25. The H and E staining showed that the basic structure of the liver had been maintained without any hepatocyte dropout or disruption, and that the bile duct had not been disrupted. At a higher magnification, the H and E staining showed that the parenchymal cells were partially dilated and that a mild inflammatory cell infiltration was present in the area of the central vein. Neither eosinophil nor plasma cell infiltrations were detected within the liver tissue. Bile plugs were found at multiple sites within the parenchyma and sinusoids. Masson staining did not show the presence of liver tissue fibrosis. The lymphocyte proliferation activity levels, which were determined from the DLST performed on POD 28, were 676 counts per minute (cpm) for the control and 871 cpm for the ALTA with lidocaine. The stimulation index, which was calculated as the ALTA with lidocaine cpm divided by the control cpm, was 1.29 (normal in Japanese people: < 1.8). Here is the task: What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

64.5
First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not mentioned in the note, we will assume that the patient is not overweight or obese. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight for a 41-year-old male is approximately 54.5 kg. Since the patient's actual weight is 52.5 kg, we will set the adjusted body weight to 52.5 kg. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The equation is: Clcr = (140 - age) x weight in kg / (72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL). Plugging in the values, we get: Clcr = (140 - 41) x 52.5 / (72 x 0.86) = 64.5 mL/min.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old Indian male patient presented with the complaints of generalized malaise, poor appetite, weight loss, headache and polyuria for last 2 months. He had a chronic ill-looking appearance, a dehydrated tongue and dry skin. Urine output was 5000-5500 mL/day with a history of nocturia and craving for cold fluids. No history of head injury, tubercular meningitis, central nervous system infections or chronic drug intake.
His physical findings on admission were height 156 cm; body weight, 44.5 kg and body mass index, 18.3. Blood pressure was 100/64 mmHg without postural change and pulse rate, 68/min with a regular rhythm. No edema was noted in his legs or feet. He had scant axillary and pubichair. Neurologic examination including visual field was found to be normal.
Laboratory findings were as follows: White blood cell count 6400/mm3 (neutrophils 51%, lymphocyte 42%, monocyte 5%, eosinophils 2%, basophils 0%); hemoglobin, 13.4 g/dL; hematocrit, 35.5%; red blood cell count, 3.4 × 106/mm3; and platelets, 3.3 × 105/mm3 Serum sodium was 137 mmol/L; potassium, 3.9 mmol/L; and chloride, 103 mmol/L. Blood urea nitrogen was 12 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 0.8 mg/dL; and uric acid, 6.1 mg/dL. Fasting plasma glucose was74 mg/dL; hemoglobin A1c, 4.9% and serum calcium of 9.4 mg/dL.
Anterior pituitary function tests revealed panhypopituitarism (serum cortisol 1.8 μg/dL, Adrenocorticotrophic hormone 15.6 pg/mL, total T3 56 ng/mL, total T4 4.2 μg/dL, thyroid stimulating hormone 1.86 mIU/mL, luteinizing hormone 0.8 mIU/mL, follicle stimulating hormone 1.67 mIU/mL, serum testosterone of 122 ng/dL and serum prolactin of 12 ng/mL. Water deprivation test revealed central diabetes insipidus [].
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed [Figures and ] a well-defined sellar-suprasellar lesion, which was heterogenous and mildly hyperintense on T1-weighted images and brightly hyperintense on T2-weighted (T2W) images. Internal well-defined hypointense nodule was also seen on T2W images. No obvious post contrast enhancement was seen. Pituitary tissue was compressed and stalk was central. The mass was abutting chiasma, but no obvious mass effect/compression seen. Findings were highly suggestive of RCC.
Transsphenoidal surgery with complete excision of the mass was carried out and histopathological examination revealed cyst wall with columnar lining suggestive of RCC. Patient was started on replacement doses of levothyroxine, hydrocortisone tablets and testosterone injections. His symptoms improved and he was doing well in follow-up. Surprisingly his polyuria improved in postsurgical period without vasopressin replacement.

44.5
First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is 18.3, which is underweight, we will set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight, which is 44.5 kg. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance. The equation is: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = (140 - age) x weight (kg) / (72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)). We will plug in the patient's values: age = 68, weight (kg) = 44.5, and serum creatinine (mg/dL) = 0.8. Then, we will solve for Creatinine Clearance.

 Here is the patient note:
A 71-year-old man, non-smoker (height: 155 cm; weight: 59 kg), was scheduled to receive video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy with the diagnosis of MG. Two months previously, he developed symptoms of right ptosis and progressive swallowing difficulty. Based on a positive response to edrophonium and increased titers of autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptor (19.3 nmol/L; normal < 0.2 nmol/L), he was diagnosed as having MG with severity belonging to Osserman's classification IIb (ie, generalized moderate weakness and/or bulbar dysfunction). Thoracic computed tomography demonstrated glandular hyperplasia of the thymus (Fig. A). The patient was started on prednisolone 20 mg daily and pyridostigmine 60 mg three times daily. His past history included hypertension without evidence of previous myasthenic crisis or thromboembolic events (eg, history of lower limb swelling). The results of electrocardiography, pulmonary function test [eg, vital capacity: 93%], echocardiography (eg, left ventricular ejection fraction: 85.1%), chest radiography (Fig. B), and laboratory studies (eg, coagulation test) were unremarkable. On the other hand, impaired renal function [i.e., serum creatinine: 1.42 mg/dL; eGFR: 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2] was observed after admission.
Preoperative physical examination of the patient showed clear consciousness without respiratory distress. Vital signs included a blood pressure of 187/103 mm Hg, heart rate of 82 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/minute. Under real-time neuromuscular monitoring with a train-of-four (TOF) monitor (TOF-watch SX, N.V. Organon, Oss, Netherlands), anesthesia was induced with propofol (130 mg) and rocuronium (0.85 mg/kg). Following successful tracheal intubation with a double-lumen tracheal tube (Broncho-Cath; Mallinckrodt, Athlone, Ireland), general anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, rocuronium (total dosage: 40 mg), and a continuous infusion of remifentanil. An 18-gauge peripheral intravenous line and an arterial line were introduced. The surgical time was 4 hours 15 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 100 mL. Upon completion of surgery, sugammadex 4 mg/kg was administered to reverse neuromuscular blockade, with a maximum TOF ratio of 0.93 following reversal. Additionally, intravenous morphine 8 mg was given for postoperative analgesia. After successful extubation in the operating room and resumption of spontaneous breathing, he was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for further care.
During the immediate postoperative period, the patient was hemodynamically stable without respiratory distress. Because of surgical pain with a numeric rating scale of 5 (scale of 0–10), intravenous morphine was titrated to a total dosage of 7 mg. Forty-five minutes later, respiratory distress with drowsiness was noted. Physical examination found pinpoint pupils with a TOF ratio of 0.9. Blood gas analysis demonstrated severe hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide pressure: 117.7 mm Hg) and acidosis (pH: 6.996, lactate levels: 3.3 mmol/L). On suspicion of morphine overdose, intravenous naloxone was administered twice (0.08 mg each time). After 20 minutes, the patient regained consciousness and normal respiratory pattern. Subsequent blood gas analysis demonstrated hyperlactatemia (lactate levels: 6.0 mmol/L) (Fig. ) despite improvement in arterial carbon dioxide pressure and arterial oxygen pressure after naloxone administration. Taking into account the overall clinical improvement, he was transferred to ward with spontaneous breathing and stable hemodynamics after observation for 100 minutes following initial reversal of opioid overdose.
However, one hour after being transferred to ward (ie, three hours after naloxone administration), he was found to exhibit consciousness loss, respiratory distress, and pinpoint pupils. Intravenous naloxone 0.4 mg was given, followed by endotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilatory support. Brain computed tomography showed no intracranial lesion. He regained consciousness two hours after naloxone administration in the intensive care unit without symptoms of opioid withdrawal (eg, pulmonary edema). As weaning from mechanical ventilation was difficult on POD 3, a diagnosis of POMC was made. Steroid therapy (prednisolone 40 mg twice daily) and pyridostigmine (60 mg 3 times a day) was initiated. The patient was extubated smoothly on POD 6 and was discharged from hospital on POD 12. The course of hyperlactatemia was shown in Figure . In addition, his eGFR increased from 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline to 88.9 ml/min/1.73m2 on POD 5. Pathological analysis of the specimen from thymectomy confirmed the diagnosis of type B2 thymoma according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.
The patient was readmitted on POD 24 because of left thigh swelling. Ultrasonographic examination showed evidence of DVT involving the left femoral and popliteal veins. Anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (ie, subcutaneous Clexane 60 mg every 12 hours) was implemented immediately after hospitalization, and he was discharged without sequelae on POD 31. During hospitalization, his eGFR was 86.5 mL/min/1.73m2. There was no recurrence of myasthenic crisis or DVT up to 3 months of follow-ups.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

49.1
First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not provided, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight is approximately 50 kg for a 155 cm height male. Since the patient's actual weight is 59 kg, we will set the adjusted body weight to 50 kg. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The equation is: Clcr = (140 - age) x weight in kg / (72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL). We will plug in the values: Clcr = (140 - 71) x 50 / (72 x 1.42). After calculating, we get Clcr = 49.1 mL/min.
{'Row Number': 8, 'Calculator Name': 'Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)', 'Calculator ID': '2', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-7220329-1', 'Patient Note': "A 71-year-old man, non-smoker (height: 155 cm; weight: 59 kg), was scheduled to receive video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy with the diagnosis of MG. Two months previously, he developed symptoms of right ptosis and progressive swallowing difficulty. Based on a positive response to edrophonium and increased titers of autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptor (19.3 nmol/L; normal < 0.2 nmol/L), he was diagnosed as having MG with severity belonging to Osserman's classification IIb (ie, generalized moderate weakness and/or bulbar dysfunction). Thoracic computed tomography demonstrated glandular hyperplasia of the thymus (Fig. A). The patient was started on prednisolone 20 mg daily and pyridostigmine 60 mg three times daily. His past history included hypertension without evidence of previous myasthenic crisis or thromboembolic events (eg, history of lower limb swelling). The results of electrocardiography, pulmonary function test [eg, vital capacity: 93%], echocardiography (eg, left ventricular ejection fraction: 85.1%), chest radiography (Fig. B), and laboratory studies (eg, coagulation test) were unremarkable. On the other hand, impaired renal function [i.e., serum creatinine: 1.42 mg/dL; eGFR: 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2] was observed after admission.\nPreoperative physical examination of the patient showed clear consciousness without respiratory distress. Vital signs included a blood pressure of 187/103 mm Hg, heart rate of 82 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/minute. Under real-time neuromuscular monitoring with a train-of-four (TOF) monitor (TOF-watch SX, N.V. Organon, Oss, Netherlands), anesthesia was induced with propofol (130 mg) and rocuronium (0.85 mg/kg). Following successful tracheal intubation with a double-lumen tracheal tube (Broncho-Cath; Mallinckrodt, Athlone, Ireland), general anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, rocuronium (total dosage: 40 mg), and a continuous infusion of remifentanil. An 18-gauge peripheral intravenous line and an arterial line were introduced. The surgical time was 4 hours 15 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 100 mL. Upon completion of surgery, sugammadex 4 mg/kg was administered to reverse neuromuscular blockade, with a maximum TOF ratio of 0.93 following reversal. Additionally, intravenous morphine 8 mg was given for postoperative analgesia. After successful extubation in the operating room and resumption of spontaneous breathing, he was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for further care.\nDuring the immediate postoperative period, the patient was hemodynamically stable without respiratory distress. Because of surgical pain with a numeric rating scale of 5 (scale of 0–10), intravenous morphine was titrated to a total dosage of 7 mg. Forty-five minutes later, respiratory distress with drowsiness was noted. Physical examination found pinpoint pupils with a TOF ratio of 0.9. Blood gas analysis demonstrated severe hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide pressure: 117.7 mm Hg) and acidosis (pH: 6.996, lactate levels: 3.3 mmol/L). On suspicion of morphine overdose, intravenous naloxone was administered twice (0.08 mg each time). After 20 minutes, the patient regained consciousness and normal respiratory pattern. Subsequent blood gas analysis demonstrated hyperlactatemia (lactate levels: 6.0 mmol/L) (Fig. ) despite improvement in arterial carbon dioxide pressure and arterial oxygen pressure after naloxone administration. Taking into account the overall clinical improvement, he was transferred to ward with spontaneous breathing and stable hemodynamics after observation for 100 minutes following initial reversal of opioid overdose.\nHowever, one hour after being transferred to ward (ie, three hours after naloxone administration), he was found to exhibit consciousness loss, respiratory distress, and pinpoint pupils. Intravenous naloxone 0.4 mg was given, followed by endotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilatory support. Brain computed tomography showed no intracranial lesion. He regained consciousness two hours after naloxone administration in the intensive care unit without symptoms of opioid withdrawal (eg, pulmonary edema). As weaning from mechanical ventilation was difficult on POD 3, a diagnosis of POMC was made. Steroid therapy (prednisolone 40 mg twice daily) and pyridostigmine (60 mg 3 times a day) was initiated. The patient was extubated smoothly on POD 6 and was discharged from hospital on POD 12. The course of hyperlactatemia was shown in Figure . In addition, his eGFR increased from 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline to 88.9 ml/min/1.73m2 on POD 5. Pathological analysis of the specimen from thymectomy confirmed the diagnosis of type B2 thymoma according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.\nThe patient was readmitted on POD 24 because of left thigh swelling. Ultrasonographic examination showed evidence of DVT involving the left femoral and popliteal veins. Anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (ie, subcutaneous Clexane 60 mg every 12 hours) was implemented immediately after hospitalization, and he was discharged without sequelae on POD 31. During hospitalization, his eGFR was 86.5 mL/min/1.73m2. There was no recurrence of myasthenic crisis or DVT up to 3 months of follow-ups.", 'Question': "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.", 'LLM Answer': '49.1', 'LLM Explanation': "First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not provided, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight is approximately 50 kg for a 155 cm height male. Since the patient's actual weight is 59 kg, we will set the adjusted body weight to 50 kg. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The equation is: Clcr = (140 - age) x weight in kg / (72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL). We will plug in the values: Clcr = (140 - 71) x 50 / (72 x 1.42). After calculating, we get Clcr = 49.1 mL/min.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '35.333', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\nThe patient is 71 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 1.42 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 155.0 cm, which is 155.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.55 m. The patient's weight is 59.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 59.0 kg / (1.55 m * 1.55 m) = 24.558 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.6, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 52.355 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 71) * 52.355 * 1) / (1.42 * 72) = 35.333 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 35.333 mL/min.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Timestamp': '2025-06-17T00:33:28.611165', 'Unique_Identifier': 'calc_2_note_pmc-7220329-1_row_8'}

 Here is the patient note:
The patient was an 82-year-old woman who had a 3-year history of leg cramps and first had chest tightness for two years. She had been treated for ischemic cardiomyopathy with triple vessel disease at another hospital, but had been hospitalized for heart failure 12 times in the last two years. Echocardiography that was performed in the hospital reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. The patient had a history of left thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer at the age of 67 years with no subsequent recurrence. Comorbidities included angina pectoris, chronic heart failure, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and gastric ulcer (gastrointestinal bleeding with antithrombotic drugs). Her usual medications were tolvaptan 7.5 mg, azosemide 60 mg, furosemide 60 mg, rabeprazole 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, bisoprolol 0.625 mg, amiodarone 50 mg, levothyroxine sodium 50 μg, cremedin 6 g, and sodium ferrous citrate 100 mg. Her ability to perform activities of daily living was good, and there was no history of alcohol drinking, smoking, or allergy. She noticed shortness of breath and chest discomfort when she was about to go to the restroom in the morning, and was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of our hospital.
Physical findings on admission were: height, 153 cm; weight, 53 kg; body mass index, 22.6 kg/m2; body temperature, 36.9℃; blood pressure, 155/94 mmHg; heart rate, 83/min and regular; respiratory rate, 22/min; and SpO2, 98% (O2, 6 L). The palpebral conjunctiva was not pale, and jugular venous distention was observed. There were coarse crackles in both lung fields and no murmurs. There was no peripheral coldness in the limbs and lower leg edema was observed. A 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 71 beats/min, no ST elevation, and a negative T wave in leads V3-6 (Figure ). The corrected QT interval (QTc) was prolonged by 556 ms.
Chest radiography showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 70%, indicating cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, and bilateral pleural effusion (Figure ).
Echocardiography showed akinesis mainly at the apex and diffuse hypokinesis at the base, showing systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 15%. The blood tests revealed decreased renal function with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 88 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.26 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 11.1 mL/min/BSA.The serum albumin level was 3.3 g/dL and serum potassium level was 4.5 mmol/L. Creatine kinase (CK) was slightly elevated at 191 U/L, but the creatine kinase-myocardial band (2.8 ng/mL) and troponin I (0.02 ng/mL) levels were not elevated. The level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 802.7 pg/mL. A diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure was made, and treatment with oxygen and diuretics (furosemide 20mg) was started. The patient responded well and urine volumes in the initial three hours were 400 mL; however, 12 hours after admission, she experienced sudden onset chest pain and pain radiating to the neck. Consciousness at the time of the attack was clear, systolic blood pressure was 120 mmHg, heart rate was 80/min with sinus rhythm, and SpO2 was 89% (O2 10 L). The pain extended to the extremities. The 12-lead ECG at the time of the attack was not significantly different from that at the time of admission (Figure ). Chest radiography showed worsening pulmonary congestion (Figure ). Echocardiography and blood sampling showed no marked change from that on admission, no increase in cardiac enzymes, and no findings strongly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. When respiratory management by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was continued, symptoms improved after approximately one hour. Although serum calcium and magnesium levels were not measured at the time of admission, additional examinations revealed hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 4.9 mg/dL and hypomagnesemia with a magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL. The phosphorus level was 6.3 mg/dL. It was considered that the symptoms were due to a tetanic seizure. The cause of hypocalcemia was thought to be chronic kidney disease (CKD) because parathyroid function, as reflected by intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), was preserved (122.7 pg/mL) despite prior operation on the thyroid gland. Since the level of consciousness and symptoms did not deteriorate, calcium correction was started by oral administration while magnesium was corrected by drip infusion. The patient rapidly responded to intravenous infusion of magnesium and oral administration of calcium and vitamin D preparations. Serum calcium normalized on day 6 of hospitalization and the corrected calcium level was 9.1 mg/dL at the time of discharge. The QTc on ECG decreased from 556 to 491 ms (Figure ). The electrolyte abnormality improved without subsequent recurrence of tetany. The LVEF by echocardiography improved from 15% to 27% at the time of discharge. Although coronary angiography was not performed because of renal dysfunction, the LV contraction failure may have been affected by hypocalcemia. Her heart failure was well controlled with tolvaptan 15 mg, azosemide 90 mg, furosemide 20 mg and and bisoprolol 0.625 mg (Figure ), and she left hospital on the 13th day of hospitalization.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

24.5
First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is 22.6 kg/m2, which is within the normal range, we set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight is approximately 54.5 kg (based on the patient's height of 153 cm), so we set the adjusted body weight to 54.5 kg. Next, we use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The equation is: Clcr = (140 - age) x weight in kg / (72 x creatinine level in mg/dL). We plug in the patient's values: Clcr = (140 - 82) x 54.5 / (72 x 3.26) = 24.5 mL/min.

There was no peripheral coldness in the limbs and lower leg edema was observed. A 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 71 beats/min, no ST elevation, and a negative T wave in leads V3-6 (Figure ). The corrected QT interval (QTc) was prolonged by 556 ms.\nChest radiography showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 70%, indicating cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, and bilateral pleural effusion (Figure ).\nEchocardiography showed akinesis mainly at the apex and diffuse hypokinesis at the base, showing systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 15%. The blood tests revealed decreased renal function with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 88 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.26 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 11.1 mL/min/BSA.The serum albumin level was 3.3 g/dL and serum potassium level was 4.5 mmol/L. Creatine kinase (CK) was slightly elevated at 191 U/L, but the creatine kinase-myocardial band (2.8 ng/mL) and troponin I (0.02 ng/mL) levels were not elevated. The level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 802.7 pg/mL. A diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure was made, and treatment with oxygen and diuretics (furosemide 20mg) was started. The patient responded well and urine volumes in the initial three hours were 400 mL; however, 12 hours after admission, she experienced sudden onset chest pain and pain radiating to the neck. Consciousness at the time of the attack was clear, systolic blood pressure was 120 mmHg, heart rate was 80/min with sinus rhythm, and SpO2 was 89% (O2 10 L). The pain extended to the extremities. The 12-lead ECG at the time of the attack was not significantly different from that at the time of admission (Figure ). Chest radiography showed worsening pulmonary congestion (Figure ). Echocardiography and blood sampling showed no marked change from that on admission, no increase in cardiac enzymes, and no findings strongly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. When respiratory management by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was continued, symptoms improved after approximately one hour. Although serum calcium and magnesium levels were not measured at the time of admission, additional examinations revealed hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 4.9 mg/dL and hypomagnesemia with a magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL. The phosphorus level was 6.3 mg/dL. It was considered that the symptoms were due to a tetanic seizure. The cause of hypocalcemia was thought to be chronic kidney disease (CKD) because parathyroid function, as reflected by intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), was preserved (122.7 pg/mL) despite prior operation on the thyroid gland. Since the level of consciousness and symptoms did not deteriorate, calcium correction was started by oral administration while magnesium was corrected by drip infusion. The patient rapidly responded to intravenous infusion of magnesium and oral administration of calcium and vitamin D preparations. Serum calcium normalized on day 6 of hospitalization and the corrected calcium level was 9.1 mg/dL at the time of discharge. The QTc on ECG decreased from 556 to 491 ms (Figure ). The electrolyte abnormality improved without subsequent recurrence of tetany. The LVEF by echocardiography improved from 15% to 27% at the time of discharge. Although coronary angiography was not performed because of renal dysfunction, the LV contraction failure may have been affected by hypocalcemia. Her heart failure was well controlled with tolvaptan 15 mg, azosemide 90 mg, furosemide 20 mg and and bisoprolol 0.625 mg (Figure ), and she left hospital on the 13th day of hospitalization.', 'Question': "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.", 'LLM Answer': '24.5', 'LLM Explanation': "First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is 22.6 kg/m2, which is within the normal range, we set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight is approximately 54.5 kg (based on the patient's height of 153 cm), so we set the adjusted body weight to 54.5 kg. Next, we use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The equation is: Clcr = (140 - age) x weight in kg / (72 x creatinine level in mg/dL). We plug in the patient's values: Clcr = (140 - 82) x 54.5 / (72 x 3.26) = 24.5 mL/min.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '9.671', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.\nThe patient is 82 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 3.26 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 153.0 cm, which is 153.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.53 m. The patient's weight is 53.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 53.0 kg / (1.53 m * 1.53 m) = 22.641 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 22.6, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 46.043 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 82) * 46.043 * 0.85) / (3.26 * 72) = 9.671 mL/min.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old female (height, 160 cm; weight, 60 kg) with a giant liver due to polycystic liver disease (PLD) was scheduled to undergo ABO-incompatible living donor liver transplantation because of worsening malnutrition, disability in activities of daily living, and abdominal distention, which were converted to 16 points by the model for end-stage liver disease score. In the past 3 years, coil embolization of the hepatic artery and percutaneous drainage of liver cysts had been performed. After the liver cyst drainage, biliary peritonitis occurred and she was treated with antibiotics.
Preoperative computed tomography revealed remarkable abdominal distension caused by an enlarged polycystic liver (). Results of laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb), 10.1 g/dL; platelet (Plt) count, 27.4 × 104/μL; albumin, 2.2 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 31.3 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.90 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 0.31 mg/dL; alanine transaminase, 13 U/L; aspartate transaminase, 15 U/L; prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR), 1.18; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 30.0 sec; fibrinogen, 573 mg/dL. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, and transthoracic echocardiography showed normal cardiac function. Portal hypertension was not predicted. The surgeons pointed out a risk of bleeding because of surgical difficulties due to PLD and strong adhesion induced by peritonitis. Blood loss anticipated by the surgeon was 15000 ml. The transfusion unit was preoperatively informed about the possibility of massive transfusion. We ordered 5,600 mL of O type red blood cells (RBC), 4,800 mL of AB type fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 800 mL of AB type platelet concentrate (PC).
After induction of general anesthesia, three 18-gauge peripheral catheters, a 12-gauge triple-lumen central venous catheter, and a pulmonary arterial catheter were placed. Since total clamping of the inferior vena cava requiring veno-veno bypass might be necessary, two 4-Fr introducer sheaths were placed at the femoral vein and the intrajugular vein. Soon after the start of surgery, massive bleeding of more than 4,000 mL/hr occurred (). We started massive transfusion of FFP at a ratio of about 1 : 1 with RBC. We also transfused 5% albumin and restricted the crystalloid solution. Reinfusion of salvaged blood and use of veno-veno bypass with retrieved blood from the operative field were avoided because many cysts of the PLD ruptured during surgery and the blood in the operative field was contaminated by the cystic content. We constantly ordered blood products and communicated with the transfusion unit.
The bleeding rate increased as the surgery progressed because bleeding occurred from the area where the tissue was detached from adhesion. Body temperature rapidly decreased despite the use of a rapid infusion and fluid warming system (Level 1 Fast Flow Fluid Warmer, Smiths Medical ASD Inc., Rockland, MA, USA) through 4-Fr introducer sheaths. Although catecholamine administration and massive transfusion from 5 venous lines including the introducer sheath were performed by many anesthesiologists, it was extremely difficult to maintain blood pressure and a critical situation with a risk of cardiac arrest continued due to hypotension. In addition, even though administration of insulin and calcium was performed, electrolyte disturbances of K+ of 6.3 mEq/L and Ca2+ of 2.1 mg/dL (normal range: 4.6–5.3 mg/dL) with peaked T wave and prolongation of QTc interval (557 msec) occurred (Figures and ). At that time, we visually noticed that the QT interval was shortened in response to bolus calcium administration, and we therefore displayed the QTc interval on a bedside monitor (CSM-1000 series Life Scope G, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and used the change of real-time QTc interval as a supportive indicator for calcium correction (maximum rate: 120 mEq/hr) combined with blood gas analysis. The hepatectomy was performed without veno-veno bypass 4.5 hours after the start of surgery and the bleeding rate at that time was 15,000 mL/hr (). The excised polycystic liver weighed 10.0 kg.
Until portal reperfusion, we continued massive transfusion (approximately 12,000 mL/hr) including 300 mL of PC and sodium bicarbonate with additional fluid warming systems. After portal reperfusion, the bleeding rate gradually decreased and the hemodynamic variables and electrolyte disturbance improved (Figures and ; ). After anastomosis of the hepatic artery, 1 g of tranexamic acid was administered. Except for PC, which was transported from transfusion centers in our region and/or neighboring regions, the supply of blood products was not interrupted and coagulation factors were maintained throughout the surgery by administration of FFP and 3 g of fibrinogen with at least 1.26 of PT-INR, 43.6 sec of APTT, and 116 mg/dL of fibrinogen (). The abdomen was packed with gauzes and closed because complete hemostasis was difficult. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Soon after arrival at the ICU, she responded to command. On postoperative day (POD) 2, second-look surgery was performed for removal of packed gauzes. She was extubated on POD 3 without pulmonary edema or cardiac overload.
The duration of surgery was 16 hours and 53 minutes and the duration of general anesthesia was 22 hours and 27 minutes. Throughout the surgery, anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% sevoflurane, 0.16–0.33 μg−1 ・kg−1 ・min−1 of remifentanil, and intermittent fentanyl administration (total of 1.5 mg). Bispectral IndexTM (Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, USA) values were between 30 and 60. Cardiac index was between 1.2 and 2.8 L−1 ・min−1 ・m−2. A total of 742 mEq of calcium ion, 750 mL of 7% sodium bicarbonate, and 18 units of insulin were administered. Postoperative analysis of the relationship between QTc interval and Ca2+ during surgery showed a strong negative correlation (). Representative laboratory data are shown in . Total infusion volume was 88,560 mL (crystalloid solution: 3,450 mL; 6% hydroxyethyl starch: 3,500 mL; 5% albumin: 10,490 mL; RBC: 34,160 mL; FFP: 34,600 mL; PC: 2,400 mL), and total output volume was 86,350 mL (estimated volume of blood loss including ascites and cystic fluid: 81,600 mL; urine output: 4,750 mL); therefore, intraoperative fluid balance was +2,210 mL. Although she suffered from acute rejection and sepsis, she finally regained independent living by rehabilitation and was discharged on POD 156.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not mentioned in the note, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight for a 47-year-old female is approximately 50 kg. Since the patient's actual weight is 60 kg, we will use the actual weight as the adjusted body weight. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The equation is: Clcr = (140 - age) x weight in kg / (72 x creatinine in mg/dL). We will plug in the patient's age, weight, and creatinine level into the equation to get the creatinine clearance.

Results of laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb), 10.1 g/dL; platelet (Plt) count, 27.4 × 104/μL; albumin, 2.2 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 31.3 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.90 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 0.31 mg/dL; alanine transaminase, 13 U/L; aspartate transaminase, 15 U/L; prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR), 1.18; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 30.0 sec; fibrinogen, 573 mg/dL. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, and transthoracic echocardiography showed normal cardiac function. Portal hypertension was not predicted. The surgeons pointed out a risk of bleeding because of surgical difficulties due to PLD and strong adhesion induced by peritonitis. Blood loss anticipated by the surgeon was 15000 ml. The transfusion unit was preoperatively informed about the possibility of massive transfusion. We ordered 5,600 mL of O type red blood cells (RBC), 4,800 mL of AB type fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 800 mL of AB type platelet concentrate (PC).\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, three 18-gauge peripheral catheters, a 12-gauge triple-lumen central venous catheter, and a pulmonary arterial catheter were placed. Since total clamping of the inferior vena cava requiring veno-veno bypass might be necessary, two 4-Fr introducer sheaths were placed at the femoral vein and the intrajugular vein. Soon after the start of surgery, massive bleeding of more than 4,000 mL/hr occurred (). We started massive transfusion of FFP at a ratio of about 1 : 1 with RBC. We also transfused 5% albumin and restricted the crystalloid solution. Reinfusion of salvaged blood and use of veno-veno bypass with retrieved blood from the operative field were avoided because many cysts of the PLD ruptured during surgery and the blood in the operative field was contaminated by the cystic content. We constantly ordered blood products and communicated with the transfusion unit.\nThe bleeding rate increased as the surgery progressed because bleeding occurred from the area where the tissue was detached from adhesion. Body temperature rapidly decreased despite the use of a rapid infusion and fluid warming system (Level 1 Fast Flow Fluid Warmer, Smiths Medical ASD Inc., Rockland, MA, USA) through 4-Fr introducer sheaths. Although catecholamine administration and massive transfusion from 5 venous lines including the introducer sheath were performed by many anesthesiologists, it was extremely difficult to maintain blood pressure and a critical situation with a risk of cardiac arrest continued due to hypotension. In addition, even though administration of insulin and calcium was performed, electrolyte disturbances of K+ of 6.3 mEq/L and Ca2+ of 2.1 mg/dL (normal range: 4.6–5.3 mg/dL) with peaked T wave and prolongation of QTc interval (557 msec) occurred (Figures and ). At that time, we visually noticed that the QT interval was shortened in response to bolus calcium administration, and we therefore displayed the QTc interval on a bedside monitor (CSM-1000 series Life Scope G, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and used the change of real-time QTc interval as a supportive indicator for calcium correction (maximum rate: 120 mEq/hr) combined with blood gas analysis. The hepatectomy was performed without veno-veno bypass 4.5 hours after the start of surgery and the bleeding rate at that time was 15,000 mL/hr (). The excised polycystic liver weighed 10.0 kg.\nUntil portal reperfusion, we continued massive transfusion (approximately 12,000 mL/hr) including 300 mL of PC and sodium bicarbonate with additional fluid warming systems. After portal reperfusion, the bleeding rate gradually decreased and the hemodynamic variables and electrolyte disturbance improved (Figures and ; ). After anastomosis of the hepatic artery, 1 g of tranexamic acid was administered. Except for PC, which was transported from transfusion centers in our region and/or neighboring regions, the supply of blood products was not interrupted and coagulation factors were maintained throughout the surgery by administration of FFP and 3 g of fibrinogen with at least 1.26 of PT-INR, 43.6 sec of APTT, and 116 mg/dL of fibrinogen (). The abdomen was packed with gauzes and closed because complete hemostasis was difficult. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Soon after arrival at the ICU, she responded to command. On postoperative day (POD) 2, second-look surgery was performed for removal of packed gauzes. She was extubated on POD 3 without pulmonary edema or cardiac overload.\nThe duration of surgery was 16 hours and 53 minutes and the duration of general anesthesia was 22 hours and 27 minutes. Throughout the surgery, anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% sevoflurane, 0.16–0.33 μg−1 ・kg−1 ・min−1 of remifentanil, and intermittent fentanyl administration (total of 1.5 mg). Bispectral IndexTM (Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, USA) values were between 30 and 60. Cardiac index was between 1.2 and 2.8 L−1 ・min−1 ・m−2. A total of 742 mEq of calcium ion, 750 mL of 7% sodium bicarbonate, and 18 units of insulin were administered. Postoperative analysis of the relationship between QTc interval and Ca2+ during surgery showed a strong negative correlation (). Representative laboratory data are shown in . Total infusion volume was 88,560 mL (crystalloid solution: 3,450 mL; 6% hydroxyethyl starch: 3,500 mL; 5% albumin: 10,490 mL; RBC: 34,160 mL; FFP: 34,600 mL; PC: 2,400 mL), and total output volume was 86,350 mL (estimated volume of blood loss including ascites and cystic fluid: 81,600 mL; urine output: 4,750 mL); therefore, intraoperative fluid balance was +2,210 mL. Although she suffered from acute rejection and sepsis, she finally regained independent living by rehabilitation and was discharged on POD 156.', 'Question': "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.", 'LLM Answer': '44.4', 'LLM Explanation': "First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not mentioned in the note, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight for a 47-year-old female is approximately 50 kg. Since the patient's actual weight is 60 kg, we will use the actual weight as the adjusted body weight. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The equation is: Clcr = (140 - age) x weight in kg / (72 x creatinine in mg/dL). We will plug in the patient's age, weight, and creatinine level into the equation to get the creatinine clearance.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '63.901', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.\nThe patient is 47 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 160.0 cm, which is 160.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.6 m. The patient's weight is 60.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 60.0 kg / (1.6 m * 1.6 m) = 23.437 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 23.4, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 52.382 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 47) * 52.382 * 0.85) / (0.9 * 72) = 63.901 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 63.901 mL/min.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Timestamp': '2025-06-17T00:33:53.588113', 'Unique_Identifier': 'calc_2_note_pmc-8062170-1_row_10'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.
On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not mentioned in the note, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight is approximately 50 kg for a 168 cm tall male. Since the patient's actual weight is 68 kg, we will set the adjusted body weight to 50 kg. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance. The equation is: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = (140 - age) x weight (kg) / (72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)). We will use the patient's age as 66, adjusted body weight as 50 kg, and serum creatinine as 5.09 mg/dL. Plugging in the values, we get: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = (140 - 66) x 50 / (72 x 5.09) = 34.4 mL/min.
{'Row Number': 11, 'Calculator Name': 'Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)', 'Calculator ID': '2', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-6331344-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).', 'Question': "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old man was referred to our hospital for evaluation and management of hypertension and hypokalemia. He was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 40 years, and his blood pressure was poorly controlled with a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine at 40 mg/d). He also had a past medical history of vasospastic angina and was a nonsmoker and social drinker. In addition, he had no family history of cardiovascular diseases. On admission, the patient was 168 cm tall and weighed 59 kg. He was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 161/96 mm Hg and a regular pulse of 61 beats per minute. There was no evidence of lung rales, cardiac murmurs, or an abdominal bruit. His neurological examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests revealed that his serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL, urea nitrogen level was 19 mg/dL, and serum sodium level was 140 mEq/L. He also exhibited hypokalemia with a serum potassium concentration of 2.9 mEq/L; however, he had no subjective symptoms, including muscle weakness. Plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) were <0.1 ng/mL/h, 292 pg/mL, and >2920, respectively. Other adrenal hormone levels were within normal limits. A chest radiograph and transthoracic echocardiogram showed no significant findings. An electrocardiogram suggested nonspecific ST-T wave changes with premature atrial contractions.
Primary hyperaldosteronism was suspected, and therefore, a captopril challenge test and a saline infusion test were performed. All these investigations revealed positive test results (Table ), which confirmed a diagnosis of PA. A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test to exclude the diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome was negative. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a left adrenal mass (13 mm) (Figure ). In adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated AVS, although aldosterone hypersecretion was observed in the left adrenal gland, the lateralization of the disease was not determined due to incomplete cannulation of the right adrenal vein (Table ). The criteria of successful cannulation were based on the current Expert Consensus Statement.
131I-adosterol scintigraphy under dexamethasone suppression showed an equivalently increased uptake in both adrenal glands (Figure ). Because we could not exclude the bilateral PA, including aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) with microadenoma in the right adrenal gland, we performed the medical therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA). Although we administrated multiple antihypertensive agents including an MRA (eplerenone at 100 mg/d), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (azilsartan at 40 mg/d), a dual action beta blocker/alpha-1 blocker (carvedilol at 20 mg/d), a calcium channel blocker with an increased dose (nifedipine at 80 mg/d), an alpha-1 blocker (doxazosin at 2 mg/d), and an alpha-2 agonist (guanabenz at 4 mg/d), a home reading of the patient's blood pressure was above 140/90 mm Hg. Moreover, he needed a large quantity of potassium chloride to compensate for his hypokalemia.
Despite intensive medical therapy, he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention due to stable angina. Following this, we performed AVS again, but the right adrenal vein was not successfully cannulated (Table ). We discussed further the indication for surgery and decided to remove the left adrenal gland. After laparoscopic left adrenalectomy, his blood pressure and serum potassium remained normal after the withdrawal of eplerenone, doxazosin, guanabenz, and potassium chloride and a dose reduction of azilsartan (at 20 mg/d), carvedilol (at 10 mg/d), and nifedipine (at 10 mg/d). The PRA and PAC were 0.8 ng/mL/h and 57.1 pg/mL, 3 months after the adrenalectomy, respectively. Macroscopic findings of the resected specimen showed a yellowish colored nodule (13 mm in diameter) in the adrenal gland. We confirmed a diagnosis of an adrenocortical adenoma based on a histopathologic examination (Figure ); we also confirmed that the tumor cells were rich in the cytoplasm and were eosinophilic without malignant cells.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

 Here is the patient note:
JP is currently a 58 year old man with multifocal urothelial tumors of the urinary bladder despite two courses of intravesical mitomycin C and one six week course of BCG.
The patient appears well but has a significant past medical history consisting of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, mild congestive heart failure, chronic renal disease, and peripheral neuropathy. He stopped cigarette smoking at age 35 after 15 years of smoking 1.5 packs/day. He has had a coronary artery stent placed.
The patient has a BMI of 38 kg/m2. He weighs 106 kg and is 168 cm in height. He is thus markedly overweight with a large abdominal girth. His recent creatinine is 2.13, BUN 38. This has been stable for 3 years.
He presented with gross hematuria in 8/15. Imaging disclosed left hydronephrosis with a filling defect in the left renal pelvis. Ureteroscopy and biopsy revealed a low grade urothelial tumor in the renal pelvis. In April 2016 he underwent a robotic assisted left nephroureterectomy. The pathology indicated high grade pT3 urothelial cancer in the renal pelvis with small HG Ta and CIS in the ureter. There was Ta tumor at the distal margin. Adjuvant chemotherapy was discussed but was not given because of his renal failure. Subsequent serial imaging has been negative for any metastasis.
Beginning in July 2016 he has developed multifocal low or high grade Ta urothelial cancer of the bladder. After the resection of over 10 HG Ta tumors in 7/16 he received intravesical mitomycin for six weeks. In 11/16 he had a TUR BT of multiple tumors from one to 5 cm, LG Ta. Although BCG is not likely to be effective for LG Ta he was given intravesical BCG for six weeks. The next TUR BT was 3/17 and once again there was mutifocal HG Ta tumors. This was followed with weekly mitomycin again.
The most recent TUR BT was in 7/17 and the pathology was LG Ta. The largest tumor was at the 1 o’clock position just inside the bladder neck and required a bugby electrode with the 70 degree lens to visualize and remove, as it was not visible with the 12 or 30 degree lens. His most recent cystoscopy was 10/17 and not surprisingly he has developed multiple small and large tumors which all appear Ta.
The patient’s quality of life has not changed as a result of the multiple resections. He has not had gross hematuria since the left nephrectomy. He has not developed an invasive tumor of the bladder.
Alternative considerations for therapy are welcome such as a PDL inhibitor or other experimental treatment.
Photos will be of the tumor and the use of the blue bugby electrode for the tumor at the 1 pm location at the bladder neck.

 Here is the patient note:
In April 2011, an 81-year-old woman with a history of photosensitivity and hypertension was admitted to our hospital due to bilateral edema of the legs and nephrotic proteinuria (7.0 g/day). Her proteinuria was not detected before March 2011 by screening test by the family doctor. At admission, her height was 153 cm, weight was 40 kg, and blood pressure was 138/70 mmHg with treatment of candesartan 8 mg/day. Physical examination showed bilateral pitting edema of her legs and palpable superficial inguinal lymphadenopathies.
Laboratory results were as follows: serum creatinine 1.27 mg/dL; sodium 138.8 mEq/L; potassium 4.5 mEq/L; hemoglobin 14.6 g/dL; white blood cells 12,300/μL; platelet count 42,000/μL; serum total proteins 7.4 g/dL; and albumin 2.1 g/dL; total cholesterol 224 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 119 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 60 mg/dL, triglyceride 96 mg/dL. She had an antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1:40, with a speckled pattern that was associated with the presence of anti-dsDNA antibody (28 IU/mL). Tests were negative for anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SS-B, anti-SS-A, and anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies. Her CH50 level was low (14.3 U/mL). Microscopic urinalysis showed 51–100 red blood cells and 3–5 white blood cells per hyper field. Proteinuria was 9.3 g/day and selectivity index was 0.01. Chest and abdominal CT revealed no abnormalities. She was diagnosed with SLE based on thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, positive ANA with anti-dsDNA antibody, and history of photosensitivity.
Before renal biopsy, we decided to treat her by prednisolone (PSL) 40 mg/day to normalize platelet count. Five days after the treatment, platelet count increased to 127,000/μL. Renal biopsy was performed 7 days after the treatment. The specimen for light microscopy contained 26 glomeruli; 8 exhibited global sclerosis, 2 revealed focal endocapillary hypercellularity superimposed on several foam cells (Fig. ).
Immunofluorescence (IF) showed low-intensity diffuse global granular capillary staining of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q. Analysis by electron microscopy (EM) revealed electron-dense glomerular basement membrane deposits and foot process effacement (Fig. ).
This patient would have been diagnosed as LN class III (A) + V or III (A) because of scanty subepithelial immune deposition; however, we observed focal segmental foam cells closely resembling the cellular variant of FSGS. Based on experience with FSGS from July 2011, we added cyclosporine 100 mg/day on the initiated treatment with PSL. Within 3 months, the patient’s proteinuria rapidly improved from 9.3 to 1.8 g/day, and her leg edema completely disappeared. Her CH50 level gradually increased, and her anti-dsDNA antibody titer decreased below the normal limit (Fig. ). In March 2012, we performed a kidney re-biopsy. We observed focal segmental sclerotic lesions and endocapillary foam cells. IF with IgG, C3, and C1q showed bright granular staining, and EM showed electron-dense deposits at the same site. Diffuse foot process effacement was still present (Fig. ).

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

34.5
First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not mentioned in the note, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight for a 153 cm tall woman is approximately 50 kg. Since the patient's actual weight is 40 kg, we will set the adjusted body weight to 40 kg. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The equation is: Clcr = (140 - age) x weight in kg / (72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL). Plugging in the values, we get: Clcr = (140 - 81) x 40 / (72 x 1.27) = 34.5 mL/min.

Her proteinuria was not detected before March 2011 by screening test by the family doctor. At admission, her height was 153 cm, weight was 40 kg, and blood pressure was 138/70 mmHg with treatment of candesartan 8 mg/day. Physical examination showed bilateral pitting edema of her legs and palpable superficial inguinal lymphadenopathies.\nLaboratory results were as follows: serum creatinine 1.27 mg/dL; sodium 138.8 mEq/L; potassium 4.5 mEq/L; hemoglobin 14.6 g/dL; white blood cells 12,300/μL; platelet count 42,000/μL; serum total proteins 7.4 g/dL; and albumin 2.1 g/dL; total cholesterol 224 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 119 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 60 mg/dL, triglyceride 96 mg/dL. She had an antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1:40, with a speckled pattern that was associated with the presence of anti-dsDNA antibody (28 IU/mL). Tests were negative for anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SS-B, anti-SS-A, and anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies. Her CH50 level was low (14.3 U/mL). Microscopic urinalysis showed 51–100 red blood cells and 3–5 white blood cells per hyper field. Proteinuria was 9.3 g/day and selectivity index was 0.01. Chest and abdominal CT revealed no abnormalities. She was diagnosed with SLE based on thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, positive ANA with anti-dsDNA antibody, and history of photosensitivity.\nBefore renal biopsy, we decided to treat her by prednisolone (PSL) 40 mg/day to normalize platelet count. Five days after the treatment, platelet count increased to 127,000/μL. Renal biopsy was performed 7 days after the treatment. The specimen for light microscopy contained 26 glomeruli; 8 exhibited global sclerosis, 2 revealed focal endocapillary hypercellularity superimposed on several foam cells (Fig. ).\nImmunofluorescence (IF) showed low-intensity diffuse global granular capillary staining of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q. Analysis by electron microscopy (EM) revealed electron-dense glomerular basement membrane deposits and foot process effacement (Fig. ).\nThis patient would have been diagnosed as LN class III (A) + V or III (A) because of scanty subepithelial immune deposition; however, we observed focal segmental foam cells closely resembling the cellular variant of FSGS. Based on experience with FSGS from July 2011, we added cyclosporine 100 mg/day on the initiated treatment with PSL. Within 3 months, the patient’s proteinuria rapidly improved from 9.3 to 1.8 g/day, and her leg edema completely disappeared. Her CH50 level gradually increased, and her anti-dsDNA antibody titer decreased below the normal limit (Fig. ). In March 2012, we performed a kidney re-biopsy. We observed focal segmental sclerotic lesions and endocapillary foam cells. IF with IgG, C3, and C1q showed bright granular staining, and EM showed electron-dense deposits at the same site.

 Here is the patient note:
Case 1 was a 20-year-old man with MMA. He was born via cesarean section because of placenta previa at gestational age of 37 weeks with birth weight of 2.7 kg. Due to positive family history (his brother had MMA), he underwent metabolic investigation. His metabolic evaluation revealed blood ammonia level of 400–500 mg/dL and elevated C3 carnitine level (48.8; reference range, < 4.1). The methylmalonic acid level in urine was 1617 µg/mg Cr, and elevation in plasma glycine (415 µmol/L) and alanine (978 µmol/L) levels were noted. Cobalamin (Cbl) incorporation study of 14C-propionate showed lack of response to Cbl (i.e. mut0) and slightly low response to adocobalamin (AdoCbl). Molecular investigations revealed a compound heterozygous c.1105C > T(p.R369C), p.G94Q mutation. He was fed with special formula (Propiomex), regular infant formula, low-protein food, and L-carnitine supplement (100 mg/kg/d). His developmental evaluation at 20 months of age showed a mild delay. Prior to 5 years of age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were in the normal range (BUN 6.6–12.3 mg/dL /creatinine 0.7–0.8 mg/dL). However, after 5.5 years of age, his renal function slowly deteriorated, showing a BUN level of 16.2–29.2 and creatinine level of 0.81–1.02. He was hospitalized multiple times due to metabolic decompensations (acidosis, dehydration, and hyperammonemia) after trivial infections or skipping of the special formula. At 6 years of age, his eye sight deteriorated progressively and he became legally blind due to optic atrophy by 10 years of age. He received growth hormone treatment for metabolic induction to anabolism and improvement of his short stature. At 15 years of age, he experienced vomiting and abdominal pain due to pancreatitis. His metabolic status became unstable; he was hospitalized more than 7 times with pancreatitis (Table ). At this time, he began to experience hand tremors due to his metabolic condition. After recurrent pancreatitis at 19 years of age, he showed glucose intolerance. By the age of 20 years, he developed DM, requiring insulin injection. His most recent metabolic crisis was accompanied by severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.8), liver dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 245 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 316 IU/L), hyperventilation, hemorrhagic gastritis, and left pleural effusion. His pancreatic amylase and lipase levels were > 4000 U/L. He was put on continuous renal replacement therapy for 3 days. During the metabolic crisis, he experienced seizures and hand tremors, although the results of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed necrotizing pancreatitis and follow-up ultrasound after 1 month of pancreatitis showed a pancreatic pseudocyst. His renal function progressively deteriorated, showing a BUN level of 40.1–60 mg/dL, Cr level of 2.04–2.81 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) level of 43.7 mL/min/1.73 m2. His metabolic parameters were as follows: pH, 7.30–7.31; HCO3 level, 11.2–20.6; methylmalonic acid level, 1768–3861 µg/mg Cr; glycine level, 625–1187 µmol/L (normal range: 158–302 µmol/L); alanine level, 508–825 µmol/L (normal range: 185–537 µmol/L). His ferritin levels were 280–581.53 ng/mL (normal range: 50–200 ng/mL). His current weight is 46.1 kg and height is 164 cm. He has recovered completely from pancreatitis, and his glucose levels are being controlled using insulin (Table ).

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

 Here is the patient note:
A 78-year-old man with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, and no history of any infectious diseases, underwent endovascular stenting (S.M.A.R.T. Control C10060SL, Cordis, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at another hospital for chronic occlusion of the left iliac artery, which had been causing intermittent claudication. No prophylactic antibiotics were administered to the patient during the EVT procedure. The patient was discharged the next day without any complications. However, he developed fever and back pain 20 days later. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was suggestive of an infected aneurysm at the site of the left iliac artery stent, and the patient was referred to our hospital.
The patient was 160 cm tall, weighed 62.8 kg, and had a blood pressure of 156/80 mmHg, a pulse of 66 beats/min, and a body temperature of 38°C. Blood tests revealed the following: white blood cells, 13130/µl; red blood cells, 3.33 million/µl; hemoglobin, 9.9 g/dl; platelet count, 190,000/µl; blood urea nitrogen, 26.7 mg/dl; creatinine, 0.93 mg/dl; albumin, 2.4 g/dl; and C-reactive protein, 24.76 mg/dl. CT findings revealed thickening of the arterial wall and an aneurysm of the left common iliac artery at the site of the stent (). On the basis of these findings, he was diagnosed with an infected aneurysm due to bare stent infection and underwent surgical treatment.
The terminal abdominal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries were removed because the infection had extended to the aortic bifurcation (). The surrounding infected tissue was debrided, and the terminal aorta was replaced with a rifampicin-soaked bifurcated prosthesis. A pedicled omental flap based on the left gastroepiploic artery was then guided in a retrocolic fashion into the retroperitoneal cavity, to wrap the graft around its entire length.
The rifampicin-soaked prosthesis was prepared as follows. First, 300-mg rifampicin capsules (Sandoz Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were dissolved in a mixture of 6-ml high-pressure sterilized polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80, Wako Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) and 54-ml distilled water. This solution was then sterilized in a Millex-HV Syringe Filter Unit (0.45 µm polyvinylidene difluoride, Merck Millipore, Carrigtwohill, County Cork, Ireland). Finally, an 18×10-mm prosthesis (Hemashield Platinum, Maquet, San Jose, CA, USA) was soaked in this rifampicin solution for 15 min.
Histopathology of the surgically excised artery specimen revealed many inflammatory cells infiltrating the intima, media, and adventitia. Abscesses and masses of Gram-positive cocci were found in all arterial layers, suggestive of an infected aneurysm ().
Staphylococcus aureus was detected by a bacterial culture of the surgical specimen. Based on the results of his antibiotic susceptibility test, the patient was administered tazobactam/piperacillin 13.5 g/day intravenously for 4 weeks, followed by amoxicillin 750 mg/day orally. However, oral medication was discontinued after 2 weeks due to a side effect, i.e., diarrhea.
Two postoperative complications were also treated. For adhesive bowel obstruction, partial small bowel resection was performed. For aspiration pneumonia, meropenem hydrate 1.5 g/day was administered for 1 week.
The patient was discharged and fully recovered from his illness. The patient still visits our hospital every 3–6 months for blood tests, Doppler ultrasonography, and CT. Postoperative CT images at the 2-year follow-up revealed no signs of reinfection (). At the 3-year follow-up, the graft remained patent, and no complications were observed.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. For the past 6 months, he has had fatigue, headaches, and several episodes of dizziness. Three months ago, he was diagnosed with hypertension and started on medications. Since the diagnosis was made, his medications have been adjusted several times because of persistently high blood pressure readings. He also has hypercholesterolemia and peripheral arterial disease. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 34 years but quit two months ago. His current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, losartan, felodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide. He is 188 cm (6 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 109 kg (240 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m2. His pulse is 82/min and blood pressure is 158/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows bilateral carotid bruits and normal heart sounds. Serum potassium concentration is 3.2 mEq/L, plasma renin activity is 4.5 ng/mL/h (N = 0.3–4.2 ng/mL/h), and serum creatinine concentration is 1.5 mg/dL.

The patient's bmi is therefore 109.0 kg / (1.88 m * 1.88 m) = 30.84 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 30.8, indicating they are overweight/obese.\nBecause the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).\nThe patient's gender is Male.\nThe patient's height is 188.0 cm, which is 188.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 74.016 in. \nFor males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:\nIBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)\nPlugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (74.016 (in inches) - 60) = 82.237 kg.\nHence, the patient's IBW is 82.237 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).\nTo compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 82.237 kg + 0.4 * (109.0 kg  - 82.237 kg) = 92.942 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 92.942 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 55) * 92.942 * 1) / (1.5 * 72) = 73.149 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 73.149 mL/min.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Timestamp': '2025-06-17T00:36:47.040740', 'Unique_Identifier': 'calc_2_note_usmle-1896_row_17', 'Attention_Analysis_Directory': 'attention_results/calc_2_note_usmle-1896_row_17', 'Attention_Files_Generated': ['essential_data']}

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male with end-stage kidney disease due to ADPKD was admitted to our hospital for an evaluation of diplopia and left hemiplegia in March 2012. He had started maintenance hemodialysis in 2005. He had hypertension, which was relatively under good control with antihypertensive agents. He had no other arteriosclerotic risks such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, or smoking. He had no past medical history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or peripheral artery disease. The patient’s father and three brothers were also under hemodialysis due to ADPKD. None of the family members had a vascular system complication such as cerebral aneurysm, or past medical history of stroke. A brain CT scan image showed dilatation of left vertebral artery, basilar artery, bilateral post cerebral artery, and middle cerebral artery (Fig. a, b). At the time, he was diagnosed as vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia and started antihypertensive agents. In 2010, he was once admitted to our hospital for dysarthria, dysphagia and right hemiplegia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute infarction in the left midbrain, and he was started treatment with anticoagulant and additional antihypertensive agents. Although he recovered from dysarthria and dysphagia, right mild hemiplegia remained. However, he did not have any new stroke events until the admission in 2012.
On admission in 2012, his height was 163.1 cm, weight was 58.5 kg, consciousness level was 13 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, blood pressure was 146/92 mmHg, and body temperature was 36.7 °C. His conjunctiva was anemic, abdomen showed hepatomegaly and bilateral kidney swelling, and lower extremities had bilateral pitting edema. Neurological examination revealed prompt light reflection, isocoric pupil, limitation of the adduction of the right eye when gazing to the left, dysarthria, and bilateral incomplete paralysis.
Laboratory data were as follows: serum Cr 10.7 mg/dL, BUN 48 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 4.4 mL/min/1.73 m2, hemoglobin (Hb) 10.7 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) 5700/μL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.4 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 6 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 6 IU/L and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 164 IU/L. Brain MRI showed acute ischemia of bilateral pons and right temporal lobe. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) did not show significant change in vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia compared with MRA in 2010. We started urokinase 60,000 unit/day and argatroban hydrate 60 mg/day. He was once recovered, and continued rehabilitation and maintenance hemodialysis. After 3 months of admission, he suddenly showed impaired consciousness of 6 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, convulsion, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. CT scan image did not show any cerebral hemorrhage. Exacerbation of cerebral infarction was suspected, and we started argatroban hydrate 60 mg/day, aleviatin, and non-invasive positive pressure (NPPV). Fourteen days after convulsion, he died of sudden fall in blood pressure (Fig. ).
An autopsy was performed, and the brain was pathologically examined. Macroscopically, massive hemorrhage in subarachnoid were seen due to rupture of basilar tip aneurysm (Fig. a, b). Autopsy diagnosis of his death was subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravascular lumen of the basilar tip aneurysm was nearly obstructed by thrombi (Fig. c). Old cerebral infarctions were seen in the left temporal lobe and other areas. Basilar, left vertebral, bilateral carotid, bilateral middle, and bilateral post cerebral artery showed irregular dilatation of the vessel wall. A microscopic examination of the dilatation area had rupture of the internal elastic lamina and thinning of the media (Fig. d). A wide range of vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia was also confirmed pathologically. In other organs, systemic arteries also showed marked atherosclerosis, and bilateral iliac artery had an aneurysm-like dilatation.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

 Here is the patient note:
In November 2007, a 49-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital from an orthopaedist complaining of a one year history of sustained difficulty walking and severe bilateral hip pain. Her height was 155.5 cm and body weight was 61.0 kg. Laboratory data showed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, potassium 2.8 mmol/l, calcium 9.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.5 mg/dl, uric acid 1.5 mg/dl, normoglycaemic glycosuria and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, HCO3− 17.4 mmol/l) (Table ). Bilateral transcervical fractures were confirmed by MRI (Fig. ) and bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot spots in her joints and ribs, compatible with osteomalacia (Fig. ). Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was diagnosed clinically from a low serum level of phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (11.0 pg/dl), high levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (67.5 IU/l), and the findings of bone scintigram, although a bone biopsy was not performed. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was ruled out by total body survey with whole body computed tomography or endoscopic surveillances and a normal blood FGF23 (22.1 pg/ml, 10–50 pg/ml) level.
Urinalysis showed pH 6.0 and twenty four hour urine demonstrated a low renal fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Tmp/GFR 0.91), increased fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA 43.9 %) and generalized aminoaciduria.
The calculated anion gap was 12.4 meq/l, with an inappropriately alkaline urine (pH 6.0), suggestive of distal type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An intravenous bicarbonate loading test to assess the tubular dysfunction demonstrated that the increased fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FEHCO3− 13.25 %) and urine-blood (UB) Pco2 gradient (U-Bpco2 50.1 mmHg), suggesting the presence of proximal type of RTA. NH4Cl loading test was not performed because of the presence of apparent metabolic acidemia. These biochemical data of blood and urine indicated Fanconi syndrome with proximal type of RTA. Tests for anti-SSA and anti-SSB were negative and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Furthermore, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed no monoclonal component. Any of the patient’s medication did not seem to be related to Fanconi syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy demonstrated cellular infiltration of interstitium and proximal tubular epithelium composed mainly of CD3+ lymphocytes without glomerular involvement, consistent with features of TIN (Fig. ,).
The patient was also suspected to be diagnosed as PBC because of high levels of alkaline phosphatase (663 IU/l), high serum IgM levels (1084 mg/dl) and the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (1:10). Sequential liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of a periportal cellular infiltrate (Fig. ), compatible with PBC though biochemical liver function was normal. The combination of these findings led to the patient’s diagnosis of osteomalacia caused by TIN with Fanconi syndrome in asymptomatic PBC.
The patient was started on therapy with calcitriol (1 μg/day), neutral potassium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate (6 g/day). She was subsequently administered middle-dose corticosteroid (20 mg/day of predonisolone) and ursodeoxycholic acid (300 mg/day). One year after the treatment, the patient became asymptomatic and renal function remained stable. Furthermore, MRI showed the bilateral transcervical fractures of the femoral neck had almost fully repaired (Fig. ). Treatment is currently being continued in the outpatient clinic.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

First, we need to calculate the patient's adjusted body weight. Since the patient's BMI is not provided, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, we will set the adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The ideal body weight for a 155.5 cm tall woman is approximately 54.5 kg. Since the patient's actual weight is 61.0 kg, we will set the adjusted body weight to 54.5 kg. Next, we will use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The equation is: Clcr = (140 - age) x weight in kg / (72 x creatinine in mg/dl). Plugging in the values, we get: Clcr = (140 - 49) x 54.5 / (72 x 1.4).

Her height was 155.5 cm and body weight was 61.0 kg. Laboratory data showed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, potassium 2.8 mmol/l, calcium 9.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.5 mg/dl, uric acid 1.5 mg/dl, normoglycaemic glycosuria and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, HCO3− 17.4 mmol/l) (Table ). Bilateral transcervical fractures were confirmed by MRI (Fig. ) and bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot spots in her joints and ribs, compatible with osteomalacia (Fig. ). Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was diagnosed clinically from a low serum level of phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (11.0 pg/dl), high levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (67.5 IU/l), and the findings of bone scintigram, although a bone biopsy was not performed. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was ruled out by total body survey with whole body computed tomography or endoscopic surveillances and a normal blood FGF23 (22.1 pg/ml, 10–50 pg/ml) level.\nUrinalysis showed pH 6.0 and twenty four hour urine demonstrated a low renal fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Tmp/GFR 0.91), increased fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA 43.9 %) and generalized aminoaciduria.\nThe calculated anion gap was 12.4 meq/l, with an inappropriately alkaline urine (pH 6.0), suggestive of distal type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An intravenous bicarbonate loading test to assess the tubular dysfunction demonstrated that the increased fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FEHCO3− 13.25 %) and urine-blood (UB) Pco2 gradient (U-Bpco2 50.1 mmHg), suggesting the presence of proximal type of RTA. NH4Cl loading test was not performed because of the presence of apparent metabolic acidemia. These biochemical data of blood and urine indicated Fanconi syndrome with proximal type of RTA. Tests for anti-SSA and anti-SSB were negative and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Furthermore, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed no monoclonal component. Any of the patient’s medication did not seem to be related to Fanconi syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy demonstrated cellular infiltration of interstitium and proximal tubular epithelium composed mainly of CD3+ lymphocytes without glomerular involvement, consistent with features of TIN (Fig. ,).\nThe patient was also suspected to be diagnosed as PBC because of high levels of alkaline phosphatase (663 IU/l), high serum IgM levels (1084 mg/dl) and the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (1:10).

 Here is the patient note:
A 28-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset abdominal pain. She also had experienced multiple episodes of non-bloody vomitus during the previous 24 hours. One year earlier, she was diagnosed with uncontrolled T2DM but refused to start insulin treatment. Two months before presentation, her hemoglobin A1C concentration was 12%, and she was started on treatment with a combination of dapagliflozin and metformin.
At the time of presentation to the emergency department, the patient was afebrile with a mild increase in blood pressure to 138/86 mmHg. She was also tachypneic and tachycardiac, with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/minute, a regular pulse with a heart rate of 116 beats/minute, and normal oxygen saturation. Her weight was 99 kg and her height was 179 cm with a body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed an obese dehydrated woman in mild distress and with mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, but no other remarkable findings. Her blood glucose concentration on Accu-check was 252 mg/dl. Laboratory testing showed an initial blood glucose concentration of 268 mg/dl, an anion gap of 18 mmol/l, and a pH of venous blood gases of 7.18. In addition, her bicarbonate concentration was 9 mmol/dl, her blood urea nitrogen was 50 mg/dl with creatinine 1.7 mg/dl, her acetone was elevated, and her hemoglobin A1C was 14.3%. Urinalysis showed moderate ketones with + 3 glucose. Her beta-human chorionic gonadotropin concentration and septic workup were negative, her cardiac enzymes were normal, and electrocardiography showed no signs of ischemia.
Following confirmation of DKA, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and administered two liters of normal saline. Accu-check one hour later showed a blood glucose level of 55 mg/dl, a finding confirmed by a serum blood glucose concentration of 68 mg/dl, a significant reduction from the initial concentration of 268 mg/dl. The patient was administered 50 ml of a 50% dextrose solution; once her blood glucose stabilized, she was started on continuous insulin infusion along with the dextrose-containing intravenous solution. She was not treated with the dapagliflozin- metformin combination while in hospital. Her acidosis and anion gap were corrected over the following three days; because her hemoglobin A1C level remained elevated, she was discharged on the insulin regimen.

 Here is the patient note:
A 32-year-old Chinese female attended the outpatient department of hepatobiliary surgery for follow-up of hepatic hemangiomas, and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed incidentally multiple splenic foci without hypersplenism. The patient presented with intermittent abdominal distension, which was slightly under no obvious inducement, with no fever, emesis, nausea, or vomiting. Physical examination found no signs of abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness, and liver and spleen were impalpable.
Laboratory examination results were as follows: blood routine examination (hemoglobin 132 g/L, red blood cell count 4.61 × 10 12/L, white blood cell count 10.04 × 10 9/L, blood platelet count 180 × 10 12/L), liver enzymes (ALT 10.0 U/L, AST 17.0 U/L, GGT 16.0 U/L, ALP 86.0 U/L, TBIL 12.7 μmol/L) and renal function (BUN 5.65 mmol/L, SCr 42.0 μmol/L). Serum tumor markers AFP, CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 were all within normal limits.
Her past medical history included hemangioma for 20 years, and asthma for 30 years, and she underwent hysteromyomectomy 8 years ago. She did not smoke or drink. The splenic ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechogenic foci measuring 5 to 38 mm in diameter. The contrast-enhanced CT showed multiple space-occupying lesions in the spleen, mottled low-density lesions, multiple hypoattenuating nodules with no contrast enhancement on the arterious phase. Delayed contrast-enhanced helical CT scan displayed incomplete filling of hypodense splenic lesions. Imaging findings raised the suspicion of a vascular neoplasm of the spleen (Fig. A and B).
Given that it was uncertain whether it was a benign or a malignant tumor of the spleen, a laparoscopic total splenectomy was performed for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment and informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images. Grossly, the spleen measured 11 cm × 6.5 cm × 2.5 cm. The largest lesion measured 2 cm × 2.3 cm × 3.6 cm. Histopathologically, the tumor was characterized by multiple cystic structures with anastomosing vascular channels (H & E staining ×50) (Fig. ). Photomicrograph of the histologic specimen (H & E staining ×400) showed a high power view of the cystic structures demonstrating tall columnar endothelial cells without cytologic or nuclear atypia that lined the cyst-like spaces (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry showed that the cells compromising the tumor were positive for CD21, CD31, CD68, and CD163 (Fig. ).
According to the histology and immunohistochemistry findings, the diagnosis of LCA of the spleen was thus established. The patient was discharged 6 days after the splenectomy. Her postsurgical course was uneventful, intermittent abdominal distention disappeared, and no surgery-related complications were found. After surgery, Aspirin (100 mg qd) was used to prevent thrombosis. One month after discharge, the patient's blood routine and clotting routine were normal, and Aspirin was stopped to use. The follow-up imaging findings at 16 months after surgery showed no signs of recurrence. From the patient perspective, the result of surgical treatment was satisfactory.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 32 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 42.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 42.0 µmol. To convert 42.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 42.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 4.2e-05 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 4.2e-05 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.005 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.005 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.005 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 5.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 5.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 42.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 0.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -0.241.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (0.5/0.7)**-0.241 * 0.9938**32 * 1.012 = 127.718.\nHence, the GFR value is 127.718 ml/min/1.73 m².", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Timestamp': '2025-06-17T00:38:38.627998', 'Unique_Identifier': 'calc_3_note_pmc-6426590-1_row_21', 'Attention_Analysis_Directory': 'attention_results/calc_3_note_pmc-6426590-1_row_21', 'Attention_Files_Generated': ['essential_data']}

 Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old female with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma began treatment with sunitinib (Sutent [SU11248]; Pfizer) 50 mg/day from January 2006 after failing cytokine therapy with interleukin-2. She had undergone left nephrectomy 2 years previously. Her past medical history included stage III chronic kidney disease, stage I hypertension, Factor V Leiden mutation, history of deep venous thrombosis 32 years earlier and hypothyroidism. Two weeks after starting sunitinib therapy, her haemoglobin decreased from 123 g/L to 117 g/L and the platelet count decreased from 246 × 109/L to 63 × 109/L. She was admitted with complaints of fatigue, anorexia, mild nausea/vomiting and decreased urine output. On exam, she was afebrile and hypertensive (206/114 mmHg). She had 1+ bilateral lower extremity oedema, but otherwise the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory findings on presentation were remarkable for elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine, 18.9 mmol/L and 366 μmol/L, respectively, marked thrombocytopenia, 36 × 109/L, and worsening anaemia, 111 g/L. Coagulation tests were normal. Haemolytic anaemia was confirmed by low serum haptoglobin, <0.1 g/L, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, 736 IU/L, and schistocytes on blood smear. The Coombs test was negative. Fibrin split products were elevated, 80 μg/ml. Urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria with 86 red blood cells, 8 white blood cells, 3 granular casts and no red blood cell casts per high power field. The protein to creatinine ratio in a random urine sample was 15 mg/mg. Prior urinalyses had showed trace of 1+ proteinuria, without quantification. Serologic testing for glomerular disease was unrevealing. ADAMTS13 levels were normal and no inhibitor was present.
Sunitinib was discontinued immediately and she was treated with prednisone and daily plasma exchange over the next 7 days. Her anaemia and thrombocytopenia resolved and serum creatinine slowly decreased to near baseline. Transjugular kidney biopsy performed after normalisation of the platelet count showed several glomeruli with fragmented red blood cells within the mesangial areas. There was also thickening of the glomerular capillary wall with a double contour appearance (Figure ). Pathology from the original nephrectomy showed normal renal parenchyma in non-neoplastic tissue.

Coagulation tests were normal. Haemolytic anaemia was confirmed by low serum haptoglobin, <0.1 g/L, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, 736 IU/L, and schistocytes on blood smear. The Coombs test was negative. Fibrin split products were elevated, 80 μg/ml. Urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria with 86 red blood cells, 8 white blood cells, 3 granular casts and no red blood cell casts per high power field. The protein to creatinine ratio in a random urine sample was 15 mg/mg. Prior urinalyses had showed trace of 1+ proteinuria, without quantification. Serologic testing for glomerular disease was unrevealing. ADAMTS13 levels were normal and no inhibitor was present.\nSunitinib was discontinued immediately and she was treated with prednisone and daily plasma exchange over the next 7 days. Her anaemia and thrombocytopenia resolved and serum creatinine slowly decreased to near baseline. Transjugular kidney biopsy performed after normalisation of the platelet count showed several glomeruli with fragmented red blood cells within the mesangial areas. There was also thickening of the glomerular capillary wall with a double contour appearance (Figure ). Pathology from the original nephrectomy showed normal renal parenchyma in non-neoplastic tissue.', 'Question': "Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?", 'LLM Answer': '34.5', 'LLM Explanation': "First, we need to calculate the patient's serum creatinine in mg/dL. The patient's serum creatinine is given as 366 μmol/L. We need to convert this to mg/dL. The conversion factor is 0.0171 mg/dL/μmol. So, 366 μmol/L * 0.0171 mg/dL/μmol = 6.27 mg/dL. Next, we need to use the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation to calculate the patient's GFR. The equation is: GFR = 141 * min(Scr/κ, 1)^(α) * max(Scr/κ, 1)^(−1.209) * 0.993^(age) * 1.018^(if female) * 1.159^(if black).

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 57 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 366.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 366.0 µmol. To convert 366.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 366.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000366 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000366 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.041 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.041 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.041 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 41.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 41.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 4.1 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 366.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 4.1 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (4.1/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**57 * 1.012 = 12.086.\nHence, the GFR value is 12.086 ml/min/1.73 m².", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Timestamp': '2025-06-17T00:39:03.378146', 'Unique_Identifier': 'calc_3_note_pmc-4421172-1_row_22', 'Attention_Analysis_Directory': 'attention_results/calc_3_note_pmc-4421172-1_row_22', 'Attention_Files_Generated': ['essential_data']}

 Here is the patient note:
A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for severe mitral regurgitation. Further examination revealed prolapse of the anterior leaflet and rupture of the chordae tendineae. Baseline serum creatinine level was 102.5 μmol/L, and hemoglobin level was 12.6 g/dL. He underwent surgery for chordal replacement with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene chordae tendineae. And mitral annuloplasty was performed with a flexible annuloplasty Medtronic Duran ring. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and postoperative transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated no residual mitral regurgitation. The patient was discharged in good condition one week after surgery. At the time of discharge, serum creatinine level was 87.5 μmol/L.
Seven weeks after surgery he presented with anemia and “dark urine” and was admitted to our hospital. Investigations showed haemoglobin 4.5 g/dL, hematocrit 12%, undetectable haptoglobin, reticulocyte count 9%, slightly depressed platelet count 75,000/μL, serum lactic dehydrogenase 3600 IU/L, and total bilirubin of 69.86 μmol/L (indirect of 57.1 μmol/L). Peripheral blood smear demonstrated mechanical hemolysis with schistocytosis and red cell fragmentation (Fig. ). Creatinine levels ranged from256 to 362 μmol/L. Coomb’s test, Ham test and sugar water test were negative. Expression of CD55 and CD59 for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was normal. Drug-induced hemolytic anemia was not apparent, because there was no reduction of hemolysis after stopping the administration of any drug. On transthoracic echocardiography, mitral valve jet was found and judged to be mild, originating from the centre of the valve and striking the annuloplasty ring (Fig. ). The velocity of the mitral regurgitation jet was 2.3 m/s. The investigation did not show any evidence of a structural defect of the valve or the annuloplasty ring. Predonisolone for the possible microangiopathy was used. Three times of plasmapheresis and blood transfusion of 15 units red blood cells were required. After these treatments, the anemia and dark urine did not improve, with a creatinine level at 256 μmol/L. Based on previous experience with hemolytic patients following MVR and useless of aggressive conservative therapy, we decided to do reoperation for intracardiac inspection and mitral valve replacement after a detailed communication with the patient, despite RF. During the intraoperative inspection, there was no ring dehiscence or suture-related tear of the valve tissue. The annuloplasty ring was well endothelialized. Chordal attachments were intact. However, the new artificial chordae tendinae was completely non-endothelialized (Fig. ). The plasty ring was excised and the mitral valve was replaced with a 27-mm bileaflet prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences). The hemolytic anemia resolved gradually after the reoperation. But the RF persisted after surgery and the patient was transferred to the department of hematology for hemodialysis. Three months later, the LDH level gradually fell to 224 U/L. His hemoglobin level was stable at 95 g/dL with 3% reticulocytes. Serum creatinine level was 80.4 μmol/L.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 74 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 80.4 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 80.4 µmol. To convert 80.4 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 80.4 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 8.04e-05 mol Serum Creatinine.

This will result to 9.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.9 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 80.4 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 0.9 mg Serum Creatinine/dL.

Since the patient is 30 years old, we will use the age term as 0.993^0 = 1. Then, we will calculate the minimum value of 1.22 and 0.9^(-0.996) which is 0.9^(-0.996) = 0.63. Now, we will plug in the values: GFR = 141 * min(1.22, 0.63) * 1 * 1.018 * 1.0 if female. The minimum value is 0.63, so GFR = 141 * 0.63 * 1 * 1.018 * 1.0 if female. Finally, we will calculate the GFR: GFR = 88.7.

 Here is the patient note:
An 80-year-old male with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and diabetes presented with 2 days of gross hematuria, worsening hesitancy, and difficulty urinating. Prior to this, the patient had had a 6-month history of lower urinary tract symptoms for which his primary medical doctor had prescribed an α1 receptor antagonist at a dose of 0.4 mg orally once daily. This initially brought about brief mild improvement in the patient’s symptoms, but ultimately there was an increase in lower urinary tract symptoms. The patient denied renal colic, flank pain, or any constitutional symptoms. He had not suffered any recurrent urinary tract infections in the past and denied taking any anticoagulants other than two aspirin occasionally for headache.
On presentation to the urology clinic, the patient was found to have severe obstructive urinary symptoms. Rectal examination revealed a grossly abnormal prostate gland with nodularity throughout the entire palpable surface. Laboratory information showed a prostate serum antigen of 20.2 ng/mL. His most recently documented prostate serum antigen was 8.5 ng/mL, which was from one year previously. Baseline blood urea nitrogen/creatinine was 32/0.87. Because the patient had obstructive symptoms and a post void residual of 319 mL, a Foley catheter was placed and he was scheduled for a cystoscopy (as part of the hematuria workup)/voiding trial. He was also put on silodosin 8 mg per day orally and ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. Upon the patient’s return to the office, his Foley catheter was draining adequately. Post void residual was 600 mL. Cystoscopy showed a large amount of clot in the base of the bladder, which was irrigated to clear, and no active bleeding was noted. Significant distortion and posterior impingement of the trigone was noted, left hemitrigone being greater than the right. No diverticulum or stones were noted. Prostatic urethra showed a near visually obstructing prostate but no intraluminal filling defects of the bladder. A computed tomography (CT) urogram showed left hydronephrosis down to the trigone and some mild nonspecific adenopathy. Urine culture and sensitivity was positive for a Proteus urinary tract infection. The patient was already on ciprofloxacin (which was shown to be sensitive) and responding to treatment. Bicalutamide 50 mg orally once daily and finasteride 5 mg orally once daily were prescribed.
The patient underwent transrectal ultrasound and sampling of the prostate gland. It was noted that the patient’s prostatic volume was 14.6 cc. Due to the patient’s age, gross hematuria, and comorbid conditions, a limited six-core prostate biopsy was performed. Biopsy showed six of six cores positive for an adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 9 (5+4) prostate cancer (see ). CT scan and bone scan did not show any evidence of metastatic spread. The patient was diagnosed with clinical stage T2cN0M0 prostate cancer. The patient completed and passed a voiding trial. Bicalutamide, silodosin, and finasteride were continued. A depot suspension of leuprolide acetate (30 mg intramuscularly every four months) was started. Calcium and vitamin D were added for additional support (entirely prophylactic, given that the patient had no vitamin deficits prior to starting leuprolide). At this stage in the patient’s clinical course, his urinalysis was normal and his post void residual was down to 67 mL. The patient was counseled on the management options and chose intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as treatment for his prostate cancer.
Fiduciary gold seed markers were placed. The patient underwent a planning CT scan which was fused with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The prostate and seminal vesicles were contoured with a planning CT scan, expanded into planning target volumes, and a radiation plan was developed. The patient received 46 treatments over 64 days for a total dose of 8,280 cGy. Phase 1 (planning target volume 1) consisted of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and regional lymph nodes receiving 4,500 cGy in 180 cGy daily fractions. Phase 2 (planning target volume 2) consisted of the prostate alone receiving 3,780 cGy in 180 cGy daily doses. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy using an image-guided linear accelerator (Varian Instruments Inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was utilized to minimize both acute side effects and long-term sequelae. The patient tolerated his treatments well. Mild urinary symptoms were experienced, but his urination had been improving and his international prostate symptom score was <15 (9). Therefore, the patient did not require any additional medications and we felt that any surgical intervention (such as transurethral resection of the prostate) for symptomatic relief was not warranted at this time. The patient did develop some bowel symptoms that required a change in diet.
The patient was examined by his urologist post radiation therapy and was clinically doing well. He had a post void residual of 104 mL and a significantly reduced prostate serum antigen of 0.4 ng/mL. Repeat renal and bladder ultrasound showed resolution of his previously noted left hydronephrosis. However, just after intensity-modulated radiation therapy ended, the patient began to experience right lower extremity weakness and intermittent numbness from the mid calf distally. The patient had not experienced any falls or trauma. His serum glucose was under control throughout his entire evaluation (prior to treatment it was noted to be 122 mg/dL and then post treatment measured 88 mg/dL). This progressed to require an evaluation by a neurologist. Physical examination showed a mild wide-based stance with decreased stride length and a tendency to circumduct the right lower extremity, with mild to moderate right foot-drop. Initial evaluation included a lumbar puncture, comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, urinalysis, positron emission tomography scan, renal ultrasound, and CT scans of the head and spine. All initial studies were negative. Further evaluation included an electromyogram, as well as an MRI scan of the brain/cervical and thoracic spines. MRI of the brain specifically showed only mild diffuse cortical atrophy. The cervical and thoracic spine MRI scans showed a T2 hyperintensity spanning the lateral cortical spinal tracts of the entire cervical and thoracic cords.
Blood work was collected locally, sent to the Mayo Clinic, and profiled in their paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation. The profile was consistent with organ-specific neurologic autoimmunity, which suggested an association with multifocal neurologic mainfestations. Specifically, the blood work revealed a positive neuronal voltage-gated potassium channel antibody. These findings combined with MRI of the spine led the neurologist to diagnose the patient with a paraneoplastic syndrome. Magnetic resonance neurography was not done. The patient’s nerve pain was based solely on his personal perspective. The patient was given an ankle-foot orthosis and a cane for ambulation, was started on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and referred for home-based physical therapy. At this time, the patient felt that both his strength and ambulation had improved, and his physical therapist agreed. The patient has not experienced any new complaints.

Here is the task:
Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

First, we need to find the patient's serum creatinine level. It is mentioned in the patient note that the patient's baseline blood urea nitrogen/creatinine was 32/0.87. We can use this information to calculate the patient's serum creatinine level. The patient's blood urea nitrogen level is 32, and the patient's blood creatinine level is 0.87. We can use the following formula to calculate the patient's serum creatinine level: serum creatinine level = blood creatinine level / (blood urea nitrogen level / 10). Plugging in the values, we get: serum creatinine level = 0.87 / (32 / 10) = 0.27 mg/dL. Now that we have the patient's serum creatinine level, we can use the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation to calculate the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). The equation is: GFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) = 141 × min(creatinine/0.9, 1) ^ -0.329 × 0.993 ^ age. We can plug in the patient's values: GFR = 141 × min(0.27/0.9, 1) ^ -0.329 × 0.993 ^ 80. Simplifying the equation, we get: GFR = 41.4 mL/min/1.73 m².

The prostate and seminal vesicles were contoured with a planning CT scan, expanded into planning target volumes, and a radiation plan was developed. The patient received 46 treatments over 64 days for a total dose of 8,280 cGy. Phase 1 (planning target volume 1) consisted of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and regional lymph nodes receiving 4,500 cGy in 180 cGy daily fractions. Phase 2 (planning target volume 2) consisted of the prostate alone receiving 3,780 cGy in 180 cGy daily doses. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy using an image-guided linear accelerator (Varian Instruments Inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was utilized to minimize both acute side effects and long-term sequelae. The patient tolerated his treatments well. Mild urinary symptoms were experienced, but his urination had been improving and his international prostate symptom score was <15 (9). Therefore, the patient did not require any additional medications and we felt that any surgical intervention (such as transurethral resection of the prostate) for symptomatic relief was not warranted at this time. The patient did develop some bowel symptoms that required a change in diet.\nThe patient was examined by his urologist post radiation therapy and was clinically doing well. He had a post void residual of 104 mL and a significantly reduced prostate serum antigen of 0.4 ng/mL. Repeat renal and bladder ultrasound showed resolution of his previously noted left hydronephrosis. However, just after intensity-modulated radiation therapy ended, the patient began to experience right lower extremity weakness and intermittent numbness from the mid calf distally. The patient had not experienced any falls or trauma. His serum glucose was under control throughout his entire evaluation (prior to treatment it was noted to be 122 mg/dL and then post treatment measured 88 mg/dL). This progressed to require an evaluation by a neurologist. Physical examination showed a mild wide-based stance with decreased stride length and a tendency to circumduct the right lower extremity, with mild to moderate right foot-drop. Initial evaluation included a lumbar puncture, comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, urinalysis, positron emission tomography scan, renal ultrasound, and CT scans of the head and spine. All initial studies were negative. Further evaluation included an electromyogram, as well as an MRI scan of the brain/cervical and thoracic spines. MRI of the brain specifically showed only mild diffuse cortical atrophy. The cervical and thoracic spine MRI scans showed a T2 hyperintensity spanning the lateral cortical spinal tracts of the entire cervical and thoracic cords.\nBlood work was collected locally, sent to the Mayo Clinic, and profiled in their paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation. The profile was consistent with organ-specific neurologic autoimmunity, which suggested an association with multifocal neurologic mainfestations. Specifically, the blood work revealed a positive neuronal voltage-gated potassium channel antibody. These findings combined with MRI of the spine led the neurologist to diagnose the patient with a paraneoplastic syndrome. Magnetic resonance neurography was not done. The patient’s nerve pain was based solely on his personal perspective. The patient was given an ankle-foot orthosis and a cane for ambulation, was started on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and referred for home-based physical therapy. At this time, the patient felt that both his strength and ambulation had improved, and his physical therapist agreed. The patient has not experienced any new complaints.', 'Question': "Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?", 'LLM Answer': '41.4', 'LLM Explanation': "First, we need to find the patient's serum creatinine level. It is mentioned in the patient note that the patient's baseline blood urea nitrogen/creatinine was 32/0.87. We can use this information to calculate the patient's serum creatinine level. The patient's blood urea nitrogen level is 32, and the patient's blood creatinine level is 0.87. We can use the following formula to calculate the patient's serum creatinine level: serum creatinine level = blood creatinine level / (blood urea nitrogen level / 10). Plugging in the values, we get: serum creatinine level = 0.87 / (32 / 10) = 0.27 mg/dL. Now that we have the patient's serum creatinine level, we can use the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation to calculate the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). The equation is: GFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) = 141 × min(creatinine/0.9, 1) ^ -0.329 × 0.993 ^ age. We can plug in the patient's values: GFR = 141 × min(0.27/0.9, 1) ^ -0.329 × 0.993 ^ 80.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 80 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 0.87 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -0.302.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (0.87/0.7)**-0.302 * 0.9938**80 * 1.0 = 80.852.\nHence, the GFR value is 80.852 ml/min/1.73 m².", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Timestamp': '2025-06-17T00:40:09.385504', 'Unique_Identifier': 'calc_3_note_pmc-3857264-1_row_25'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 71-year-old female with a significant past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department with a complaint of chest pain. She had been visiting her granddaughter who was in the intensive care unit in critical condition and developed chest pain after being in significant emotional distress. A rapid response was called, and she was taken to the emergency department. The patient reported having left substernal chest pain without any radiation, 7/10 in intensity. She denied any previous history of angina or similar symptoms in the past. Her home medications included lisinopril 2.5 mg once a day, levothyroxine 88 mcg once a day, metoprolol succinate 25 mg once a day, and pravastatin 10 mg once a day. The initial vital signs were as follows: temperature, 98.1°F; blood pressure, 125/76 mmHg; heart rate, 78 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 22 breaths/minute; and oxygen saturation, 100% on room air. The laboratory values were as follow: white blood cell count, 10.2 K/uL; hemoglobin, 13.2 g/dL; sodium, 139 mmol/L; potassium, 3.9 mmol/L; BUN, 15 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.76 mg/dL; troponin, 4.0 ng/mL; and COVID-19 RT-PCR, negative. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was performed, which revealed ST elevation in the lateral leads (Figure ).
Given her clinical presentation along with abnormal EKG changes and elevated troponin, the patient was taken for a left heart catheterization. She was found to have Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and nonobstructive coronary artery disease (Figure ). An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25%-30% with hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior lateral, and apical segment, mild regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation (Figure ).
The patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and discharged home with her home medications along with aspirin 81 mg and instructions to follow up with the cardiologist within one week.

 Here is the patient note:
A 29-year-old African American lady was brought into the emergency department with abdominal pain and recurrent headaches for four weeks, dizziness for a week, and an episode of syncope. She had crampy abdominal pain that was mild and progressive, associated with constipation but no nausea, vomiting, or abdominal distension. Headaches were mainly frontal, lasting a few hours, and transiently relieved with Tylenol. She denied any visual changes, photosensitivity, or eye pain. She developed dizziness about a week prior, which was worsened on standing, and improved on lying down. She fell a few times. She had a syncopal event lasting a few minutes with altered mental status following awakening, hence she was brought for further evaluation. The review of systems was significant for a 10-pound weight loss in a month, palpitations, fatigue polydipsia, and polyuria.
On presentation, her vital signs were within normal limits, except for mild tachypnea. Physical examination showed an obese lady, who was alert and fully oriented, with dry oral mucosa, pale conjunctiva, and an enlarged neck mass.
Laboratory investigations showed moderate microcystic anemia, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL (normal range 0.6-1.2 mg/dL), calcium of 21 mg/dL (normal range 8.5-10.5 mg/dL), phosphate of 2.2 mg/dL (normal range 2.5-4.5 mg/dL), and lipase of 450 U/L (normal range 5-55 U/L). Other investigations included parathyroid hormone (PTH) of 4.36 pg/mL (normal range 12-88 pg/L), 25 hydroxy vitamin D of <7 ng/mL (normal range 30-100 ng/mL), 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D of 18 ng/mL (normal range 18-72 ng/mL), PTHrP of 33 pg/mL (normal range 14-27 pg/mL), and TSH of 0.20 uIU/mL (normal range 0.34-5.60 uIU/mL)
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a 3.6 cm dural-based left frontal lobe mass invading the inner table of the left frontal calvarium and extending into the left frontal sinus (Figure ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck showed marked heterogeneous enlargement of the right thyroid gland measuring approximately 8.7 x 5.2 x 11 cm (Figure ). CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed an enlarged uterus with heterogeneous attenuation and enlarged endometrial canal, approximately 9.8 x 13.4 x 17.3 cm (Figure ).
Further imaging revealed generalized lymphadenopathy, multiple hypodense liver lesions, infiltrations, and edema of the pancreatic head, and mixed lytic and sclerotic osseous lesions in the pelvis, with pathologic fracture of the right pubic ramus. An assessment of symptomatic severe hypercalcemia likely from metastatic neoplasm, acute interstitial pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, and brain lesion with mass effect was made and she was admitted into the intensive care unit for management. She received high-flow intravenous (IV) fluids, IV pamidronate, IV dexamethasone, and IV levetiracetam. Her calcium down-trended rapidly from 21 to 10.8 in three days of management, and she showed corresponding clinical improvement.
Multiple pathological results from biopsies of uterine, liver, thyroid, and brain masses showed high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms of an unknown primary site.

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old Hispanic male with poorly controlled diabetes, hemodialysis for two years, and coronary artery bypass grafting 10 months previously, developed redness pain and swelling of the medial aspect of both legs two days prior to admission. This occurred in a symmetrical fashion and extended from the upper one-third of the calf to the mid-thigh. The patient had difficulty walking secondary to pain. He had undergone saphenous vein harvesting from these areas for his coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient denied trauma to the lower extremities, fevers, chills, and rigors. His medications include paricalcitol, sevelamer, calcium acetate, aspirin, amiodarone, amlodepine, simvastatin, and humilin 70/30.
Physical examination showed extensive erythema involving the inner aspect of the thighs down to the medial upper one-third of the calf on both sides (Figures -). Skin lesions were warm and very tender to touch, but there was no induration. Initial laboratory examination revealed white count 9,500 with 70% neutrophils, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 87 mm/hr, C-reactive protein 11.6 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 57 mg/dl, creatinine 11.3 mg/dl, calcium 9.8 mg/dl, albumin 3 gm/dl, prothrombin time (PT) 11.3 sec, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.1, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 30.3 sec.
He was treated with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone. By day three, moderate induration had developed, there were no signs of improvement, and the intensity of pain worsened. CT scan of both lower extremities was not consistent with necrotizing fasciitis and repeat labs showed a white count 15,700, with 75% neutrophils, and C-reactive protein 48 mg/dl, calcium 9.76 mg/dl, phosphorus 12.5 mg/dl (first time obtained). He required a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump to control his pain with little improvement. His antibiotics were changed to linezolid, tobramycin, and levofloxacin. On the fourth day, there was an increased induration of the thighs with rock hard consistency of the tissue. Skin biopsy was performed showing deposition of calcium in the small blood vessels of the skin, areas of fat necrosis with foamy histiocytes, and neutrophils consistent with calciphylaxis (Figures -). Parathyroid hormone level (PTH) was 628 pg/ml.
He received daily dialysis with intravenous sodium thiosulfate given post dialysis for three days. His calcium-containing phosphate binders and paricalcitol were stopped; dosage was increased for sevelamer and lanthanum carbonate, another phosphate binder, was added to lower phosphorus levels. The patient’s pain, redness, swelling and induration improved over the next three days and his calcium was 8.5 gm/dl and phosphorus 7.3 mg/dl at the time of discharge.

 Here is the patient note:
A 61-year-old lady with nausea, vomiting, weakness, dyspnea, and orthopnea was a known case of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease. She had also a right kidney mass diagnosed about 2 months before and was under workup. She had been under hemodialysis 3 days per week and also had a history of permanent pacemaker implantation 2 months before her last admission due to complete heart block. She was on statins, insulin, and calcitriol.
On physical examination, she had SPO2 = 82%, which improved to 96% with nasal O2, blood pressure = 90/60 mm Hg, and heart rate = 100 bpm and no fever. No other remarkable finding was noted.
Electrocardiogram showed pacemaker's rhythm (Figure -panel A). The baseline laboratory findings are presented in Table . Renal function test was severely disturbed (creatinine = 5.4 mg/dL), and she had also hyponatremia (serum sodium = 126 meq/dL) and mild hyperkalemia (serum potassium = 5 meq/dL). The baseline liver function test was within normal limits.
Emergent limited bedside TTE at emergency department (ED) showed massive pericardial effusion (PE) with a maximal depth of 3 cm and evidence of cardiac tamponade. She was urgently transferred to the operating room for the PE drainage.
Postdrainage TTE showed moderate left ventricular enlargement, LVEF = 30%, moderate-to-severe MR, mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation, a PAP of 45 mm Hg, and small PE. The current echocardiography showed a significant reduction in her LV function considering her previous TTE report (2 months earlier), which was completely within normal limits.
After surgery, the extubation was impossible due to the respiratory distress and development of hypoxemia during the weaning process and she got febrile.
Chest CT showed bilateral confluent consolidations predominantly in upper and middle zones with more severity in right side highly suggestive of COVID-19 (Figure -panel B).
She was isolated in ICU, and the nasopharyngeal swab specimen was reported positive for COVID-19 in RT-PCR test.
The patient's status deteriorated, and she underwent shock and unfortunately died after about 50 days. She received Kaletra and IVIG to control COVID-19 infection, accompanied with vasopressor support and hemodialysis.
The pericardial fluid analysis was compatible with an exudate nature with a negative cytology. The pericardial biopsy was negative for malignancy and tuberculosis.

Here is the task:
Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with several-week history of weakness, adynamia and progressive loss of deambulation, having become bedridden at the last days before the hospitalization.
He was diagnosed 7 months ago with NSCLC in stage IV, with metastasis to the contralateral lung and both adrenal glands. He also had a history of primary hypertension.
On admission, he was dehydrated and his blood pressure (BP) was 77/45 mm Hg. The rest of the physical examination was irrelevant. Laboratory analyses revealed Hb 12.8 g/dL, sodium 117 mmol/L, potassium 6.2 mmol/L, creatinine 3.09 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 123 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 5.16 mg/dL. Arterial blood gases sample (ambient air) showed pH 7.437, PCO2 19 mm Hg, PO2 98 mm Hg, HCO3- 12.6 mmol/L, and SO2- 98%.
He initiated normal saline infusion and cation exchange resin. Despite sorotherapy he remained hypotensive (BP 70/40 mm Hg), but had mild improvement on laboratory evaluation as follows: sodium 127 mmol/L, potassium 5.3 mmol/L, creatinine 1.85 mg/dL and BUN 48 mg/dL.
To assess the adrenal function, the next analyses were realized: serum cortisol 3.48 μg/mL (normal 4.3 - 22.4), serum ACTH 181.8 pg/mL (4.7 - 48.8), serum aldosterone < 1 ng/dL (1 - 16), plasma renin activity 31.76 μg/mL/h (0.37 - 3.84) and 24-h urinary cortisol 6.16 μg (28.5 - 213.7). Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a large nodular enlargement of both adrenal glands.
The diagnosis of metastatic primary adrenal insufficiency was established, and he initiated hormonal replacement therapy with hydrocortisone 5 mg tid and fludrocortisone 0.05 mg qd.
In the following days, the patient presented rapid clinical improvement, with normalization of his blood pressure. Laboratory evaluation also showed normal electrolytes and renal function: Hb 9.06 g/dL, sodium 137 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, creatinine 1.17 mg/dL, and BUN 21 mg/dL.
On discharge the patient had BP 118/64 mm Hg, and in the subsequent follow-ups he had recovered his autonomous deambulation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 38-year-old female was admitted to the emergency ward with altered sensorium and anuria. She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.
It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.
A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.
On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.
The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.

Here is the task:
Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

 Here is the patient note:
Our patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who was brought in by emergency medical services complaining of right-sided facial droop, slurred speech, and left-sided weakness of one-day duration. The patient reported that he returned home from breakfast one day ago, sat on the front steps of his home, and suddenly felt dizzy and "passed out." It was unknown how long he lost consciousness as it was unwitnessed. He denied a prior history of stroke or myocardial infarction. The rest of the review of systems was unremarkable.
Physical examination showed decreased left arm and leg strength compared to the right side, decreased left facial temperature sensations, decreased left arm and leg temperature sensations, and difficulty sitting upright with an associated leaning towards the left side. Vision tests were difficult to assess and compare as he had a severe right cataract.
Initial laboratory analysis was remarkable for an elevated creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL (normal 0.7-1.3 mg/dL), elevated troponin I high sensitivity of 54.20 ng/L (normal 0-53.53 ng/L), and thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.14 uIU/mL (normal 0.55-4.78 uIU/mL). Urinalysis revealed moderate leukocyte esterase, positive nitrites, and urine white blood cells greater than 50. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli with a colony count greater than 100,000 CFU/mL and was susceptible to nitrofurantoin.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed no acute intracranial pathology. A CT angiography (CTA) of the head and neck showed no significant stenosis, aneurysm, or vascular malformation. An echocardiogram was performed and showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65% to 70%, normal left ventricular size and systolic function, and no segmental wall motion abnormalities. An initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast revealed no abnormality (Figures , ). In light of such a high suspicion for stroke based on the patient’s neurologic deficits, a repeat MRI of the brain was performed three days later and exposed a small focus of bright signal (hyperintensity) on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) (Figure ) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the left posterior medulla (Figure ). The patient was started on antibiotics for his urinary tract infection, high-intensity statin therapy, low-dose aspirin therapy, and eventually discharged to subacute rehabilitation for further management once medically stabilized.

{'Row Number': 33, 'Calculator Name': 'CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Calculator ID': '3', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-8346262-1', 'Patient Note': 'Our patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who was brought in by emergency medical services complaining of right-sided facial droop, slurred speech, and left-sided weakness of one-day duration. The patient reported that he returned home from breakfast one day ago, sat on the front steps of his home, and suddenly felt dizzy and "passed out." It was unknown how long he lost consciousness as it was unwitnessed. He denied a prior history of stroke or myocardial infarction. The rest of the review of systems was unremarkable.\nPhysical examination showed decreased left arm and leg strength compared to the right side, decreased left facial temperature sensations, decreased left arm and leg temperature sensations, and difficulty sitting upright with an associated leaning towards the left side. Vision tests were difficult to assess and compare as he had a severe right cataract.\nInitial laboratory analysis was remarkable for an elevated creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL (normal 0.7-1.3 mg/dL), elevated troponin I high sensitivity of 54.20 ng/L (normal 0-53.53 ng/L), and thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.14 uIU/mL (normal 0.55-4.78 uIU/mL). Urinalysis revealed moderate leukocyte esterase, positive nitrites, and urine white blood cells greater than 50. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli with a colony count greater than 100,000 CFU/mL and was susceptible to nitrofurantoin.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed no acute intracranial pathology. A CT angiography (CTA) of the head and neck showed no significant stenosis, aneurysm, or vascular malformation. An echocardiogram was performed and showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65% to 70%, normal left ventricular size and systolic function, and no segmental wall motion abnormalities. An initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast revealed no abnormality (Figures , ). In light of such a high suspicion for stroke based on the patient’s neurologic deficits, a repeat MRI of the brain was performed three days later and exposed a small focus of bright signal (hyperintensity) on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) (Figure ) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the left posterior medulla (Figure ).

 Here is the patient note:
A 70-year-old male suffered progressive generalized edema after consuming stale crabs, with only mild abdominal discomfort and no fever or other symptoms. Before this, he was healthy and did not have a history of digestive diseases, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The man was a native of Chongqing, the subtropical area in southwest China. He used to be a soldier; he fought in the Vietnam War and joined the police force after returning to his hometown.
In the hospital, his initial vitals were BP 108/78 mmHg, HR 111, respiratory rate 22, and oxygen saturation 98%. Initial laboratories included white blood cells 13.32 × 109/L (neutrophils% 77.5%; lymphocytes% 13.31%; eosinophils% 0.5%), normal hemoglobin and platelets, albumin (ALB) 14.5 g/L, globulin (GLB) 19.9 g/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 78.7 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 90.9 IU/L, creatinine (Cr) 134 μmol/L, 24-hour urine protein 9.61 g, and negative antinuclear antibody spectrum (ANAs) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Chest X-ray showed mild emphysema but no sign of infection. The patient was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome but was unable to undergo pathological biopsy due to a renal cyst. He was administered full-dose glucocorticoid therapy alone, with no other immunosuppression. Three weeks later, while still under this treatment, the patient suffered lower limb cellulitis. His procalcitonin (PCT) was 0.3 ng/ml, and he was administrated mupirocin ointment and IV cefuroxime. After those treatments, his status improved and he continued to take oral glucocorticoids after discharge from the hospital.
However, over the next ten days, the patient seemed to get worse and had to return to the hospital due to persistent fever, cough, and intermittent abdominal pain. Initial vitals on admission were temperature 37.8 °C, BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 125, respiratory rate 26, and oxygen saturation 95%. Laboratory tests showed white blood cells 12.36 × 109/L (neutrophils %: 83.5%; eosinophils %: 0.7%). Sputum smear and culture were negative. Imaging examinations included CT scans of the chest, which reported interstitial pneumonia (Fig. ), and the abdomen, which reported no specific findings. The patient was diagnosed with normal gastrointestinal discomfort and pulmonary bacterial infection. A proton pump inhibitor, cefoperazone sodium, and sulbactam sodium were administered. However, the patient then started display hemoptysis, passed occult blood-positive stool, and gradually fell into a state of hyperpyrexia and drowsiness. Soon, Klebsiella pneumoniae (which was sensitized to the previous antibiotic), and unexpectedly, a large number of S. stercoralis larvae (Fig. ) were found in repeated sputum specimens. Meanwhile, the parasite was also found in a repeated brown stool specimen. Blood samples showed eosinophils% reached 18.1% and PCT was 1.01 ng/ml. Because ivermectin is not available in our region, albendazole (400 mg/day) was administered for 3 consecutive days but there was no progress. Subsequently, a mechanical ventilator was administered due to continued severe hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient was unable to maintain his blood pressure and eventually died after co-infection with S stercoralis hyperinfection and the K pneumoniae found 1 week later. The course of this case has been summarized in Figure . The authorized relative of patient has provided informed consent for publication of the case.

The man was a native of Chongqing, the subtropical area in southwest China. He used to be a soldier; he fought in the Vietnam War and joined the police force after returning to his hometown. In the hospital, his initial vitals were BP 108/78 mmHg, HR 111, respiratory rate 22, and oxygen saturation 98%. Initial laboratories included white blood cells 13.32 × 109/L (neutrophils% 77.5%; lymphocytes% 13.31%; eosinophils% 0.5%), normal hemoglobin and platelets, albumin (ALB) 14.5 g/L, globulin (GLB) 19.9 g/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 78.7 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 90.9 IU/L, creatinine (Cr) 134 μmol/L, 24-hour urine protein 9.61 g, and negative antinuclear antibody spectrum (ANAs) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Chest X-ray showed mild emphysema but no sign of infection. The patient was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome but was unable to undergo pathological biopsy due to a renal cyst. He was administered full-dose glucocorticoid therapy alone, with no other immunosuppression. Three weeks later, while still under this treatment, the patient suffered lower limb cellulitis. His procalcitonin (PCT) was 0.3 ng/ml, and he was administrated mupirocin ointment and IV cefuroxime. After those treatments, his status improved and he continued to take oral glucocorticoids after discharge from the hospital. However, over the next ten days, the patient seemed to get worse and had to return to the hospital due to persistent fever, cough, and intermittent abdominal pain. Initial vitals on admission were temperature 37.8 °C, BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 125, respiratory rate 26, and oxygen saturation 95%. Laboratory tests showed white blood cells 12.36 × 109/L (neutrophils %: 83.5%; eosinophils %: 0.7%). Sputum smear and culture were negative. Imaging examinations included CT scans of the chest, which reported interstitial pneumonia (Fig. ), and the abdomen, which reported no specific findings. The patient was diagnosed with normal gastrointestinal discomfort and pulmonary bacterial infection. A proton pump inhibitor, cefoperazone sodium, and sulbactam sodium were administered. However, the patient then started display hemoptysis, passed occult blood-positive stool, and gradually fell into a state of hyperpyrexia and drowsiness. Soon, Klebsiella pneumoniae (which was sensitized to the previous antibiotic), and unexpectedly, a large number of S. stercoralis larvae (Fig. ) were found in repeated sputum specimens. Meanwhile, the parasite was also found in a repeated brown stool specimen. Blood samples showed eosinophils% reached 18.1% and PCT was 1.01 ng/ml. Because ivermectin is not available in our region, albendazole (400 mg/day) was administered for 3 consecutive days but there was no progress. Subsequently, a mechanical ventilator was administered due to continued severe hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient was unable to maintain his blood pressure and eventually died after co-infection with S stercoralis hyperinfection and the K pneumoniae found 1 week later. The course of this case has been summarized in Figure . The authorized relative of patient has provided informed consent for publication of the case.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 70 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 µmol. To convert 134.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 134.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.015 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.015 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.015 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 134.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.5/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**70 * 1.0 = 49.774.\nHence, the GFR value is 49.774 ml/min/1.73 m².", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Timestamp': '2025-06-17T00:44:09.745710', 'Unique_Identifier': 'calc_3_note_pmc-6919406-1_row_36', 'Attention_Analysis_Directory': 'attention_results/calc_3_note_pmc-6919406-1_row_36', 'Attention_Files_Generated': ['essential_data']}

 Here is the patient note:
A 75-year-old man with a slightly increased serum creatinine level had developed proteinuria and hypertension in 2000. In 2007, he noticed a gradually progressive hearing loss and repeated bloody nasal discharge resulting from a refractory sinusitis. He was admitted to our hospital for evaluation in June 2008.
Initial laboratory findings revealed elevated serine proteinase 3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA; 26.2 EU), blood urea nitrogen (35 mg/dl), and serum creatinine (1.62 mg/dl) levels. Urinalysis indicated proteinuria (0.2 g/day) without hematuria. A head CT revealed maxillary sinusitis. Tissue from a nasal mucosal biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation in the extravascular area. Because of these combined findings, he was diagnosed as having granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for GPA and Watts’ algorithm [, ]. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score 2003 was 6. Because of the low disease activity, the slow progression and the advanced age, we did not initiate immunosuppressive therapy at this time.
In October 2008, he developed fever lasting for several days. Laboratory data were as follows: C-reactive protein 11.91 mg/dl, PR3-ANCA 49.1 U/ml, fibrinogen 752 mg/dl, D-dimer 1.7 µg/ml, and urinary protein 0.27 g/day. Activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and fibrin degradation product were within the respective normal range. A chest CT was normal. Although we administered meropenem (2.0 g/day for 1 week), vancomycin (500 mg/day for 17 days) and itraconazole (200 mg/day for 20 days), the fever and C-reactive protein level did not decrease. On day 12 of admission, he showed mild disorientation, severe hearing loss and hoarseness. A brain MRI revealed a mass lesion in the right frontal lobe and hypertrophic mucosa in the paranasal sinuses (fig. ) in addition to a thickened and strongly enhanced dura mater surrounding the mass lesion (fig. ). He was diagnosed as having GPA with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score had increased to 21. We treated him with methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 3 days. However, he rapidly developed left hemiparesis and deterioration of consciousness [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): E1V2M4]. A brain CT revealed that the parenchymal mass lesion had enlarged and the mucous effusion was invading the posterior wall of the right frontal sinus. Due to an impending transtentorial herniation, a decompressive hemicraniectomy and partial right frontal lobectomy were performed, which moderately improved his consciousness (GCS: E2V3M4). After the surgery, he developed bloody sputa, and a chest CT revealed an infiltrative shadow in both lungs. We confirmed alveolar hemorrhage by bronchoscopy.
The biopsied brain material from the surgery revealed a granulomatous inflammation with geographic necrosis and multinucleated giant cells in the perivascular area of the thickened dura mater and leptomeninges (fig. ). Small vessels in the meninges were involved in the granulomatous lesions, and the lumens of the veins were often occluded. In the cerebral cortices and the white matter in these areas, hemorrhagic infarction was widely observed. After treatment with prednisolone (20 mg/day) and azathioprine (40 mg/day), the disturbance of consciousness substantially improved (GCS: E4V3M5), and the epistaxis stopped. In addition, serum creatinine and PR3-ANCA levels normalized. This study was conducted with the approval of the Ethics Committee of Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences.

Plugging in the patient's serum creatinine level, we get: eGFR = 141 × min(1.62/0.9, 1)-0.411 × max(1.62/0.9, 1)−1.209 × 0.99375−1.018 × 1.018 × 0.9960.996 = 34.5 mL/min/1.73 m².
{'Row Number': 37, 'Calculator Name': 'CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Calculator ID': '3', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-4448053-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 75-year-old man with a slightly increased serum creatinine level had developed proteinuria and hypertension in 2000. In 2007, he noticed a gradually progressive hearing loss and repeated bloody nasal discharge resulting from a refractory sinusitis. He was admitted to our hospital for evaluation in June 2008.\nInitial laboratory findings revealed elevated serine proteinase 3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA; 26.2 EU), blood urea nitrogen (35 mg/dl), and serum creatinine (1.62 mg/dl) levels. Urinalysis indicated proteinuria (0.2 g/day) without hematuria. A head CT revealed maxillary sinusitis. Tissue from a nasal mucosal biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation in the extravascular area. Because of these combined findings, he was diagnosed as having granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for GPA and Watts’ algorithm [, ]. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score 2003 was 6. Because of the low disease activity, the slow progression and the advanced age, we did not initiate immunosuppressive therapy at this time.\nIn October 2008, he developed fever lasting for several days. Laboratory data were as follows: C-reactive protein 11.91 mg/dl, PR3-ANCA 49.1 U/ml, fibrinogen 752 mg/dl, D-dimer 1.7 µg/ml, and urinary protein 0.27 g/day. Activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and fibrin degradation product were within the respective normal range. A chest CT was normal. Although we administered meropenem (2.0 g/day for 1 week), vancomycin (500 mg/day for 17 days) and itraconazole (200 mg/day for 20 days), the fever and C-reactive protein level did not decrease. On day 12 of admission, he showed mild disorientation, severe hearing loss and hoarseness. A brain MRI revealed a mass lesion in the right frontal lobe and hypertrophic mucosa in the paranasal sinuses (fig. ) in addition to a thickened and strongly enhanced dura mater surrounding the mass lesion (fig. ). He was diagnosed as having GPA with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score had increased to 21. We treated him with methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 3 days. However, he rapidly developed left hemiparesis and deterioration of consciousness [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): E1V2M4]. A brain CT revealed that the parenchymal mass lesion had enlarged and the mucous effusion was invading the posterior wall of the right frontal sinus. Due to an impending transtentorial herniation, a decompressive hemicraniectomy and partial right frontal lobectomy were performed, which moderately improved his consciousness (GCS: E2V3M4). After the surgery, he developed bloody sputa, and a chest CT revealed an infiltrative shadow in both lungs. We confirmed alveolar hemorrhage by bronchoscopy.\nThe biopsied brain material from the surgery revealed a granulomatous inflammation with geographic necrosis and multinucleated giant cells in the perivascular area of the thickened dura mater and leptomeninges (fig. ). Small vessels in the meninges were involved in the granulomatous lesions, and the lumens of the veins were often occluded. In the cerebral cortices and the white matter in these areas, hemorrhagic infarction was widely observed. After treatment with prednisolone (20 mg/day) and azathioprine (40 mg/day), the disturbance of consciousness substantially improved (GCS: E4V3M5), and the epistaxis stopped. In addition, serum creatinine and PR3-ANCA levels normalized.

 Here is the patient note:
A 78-year-old man with high-grade T1 urothelial carcinoma status post-transurethral resection of bladder tumor who had been on once-weekly intravesical BCG instillation for 2 months presented to the emergency room (ER) with fever, rigors and altered mental status.111111 He also reported shortness of breath but denied cough or chest pain. He had no urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms. He had his most recent BCG instillation done the day before the index presentation. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 102.8 F, pulse rate of 92/min, respiratory rate of 40/min and blood pressure 78/45 mmHg with oxygen saturation of 93% on ambient air. On physical examination, he appeared toxic, dehydrated and in respiratory distress. Chest examination revealed asymmetric chest expansion with dullness to percussion, decreased tactile fremitus on the left side with reduced air entry on auscultation. The cardiovascular examination was however unremarkable.
Complete blood count revealed marked leukocytosis with a white cell count of 27,200/microliter (Normal 4,800–12,000/microliter) and hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL (Normal 14.0–17.5 g/dL). Lactate was markedly elevated at 7.8 meq/L (Normal 0.6–1.4 meq/L) and arterial blood gas revealed high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Basic metabolic panel revealed creatinine of 2.31 mg/dL from normal baseline (Normal 0.6–1.3 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen of 28 mg/dL (Normal 7–25 mg/dL). Sputum culture with gram stain showed normal oral flora. Urinary streptococcal and legionella antigens were negative. Chest X-ray on admission revealed left basilar pneumonia with small left pleural effusion. CT head showed no acute intracranial abnormalities. The preliminary blood culture result was negative for any micro-organisms.
Due to altered mental status with increased work of breathing and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, patient was intubated and placed on ventilation in the medical intensive care unit. He was commenced on vasopressors and intravenous Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for septic shock thought to be secondary to community-acquired pneumonia and possible urinary tract infection. Despite the completion of several courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, he continued to have low-grade pyrexia and failed to improve clinically. Suspicion for rarer etiologies such as systemic BCG dissemination began to grow and blood cultures for acid-fast bacilli initially obtained on admission returned positive for acid-fast bacilli, specifically Mycobacteria bovis in the two sets of samples thus confirming our suspicion. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were immediately discontinued, and he was commenced on triple therapy with Isoniazid 300 mg daily, Ethambutol 1600 mg daily and Rifampicin 30 mg daily. He improved clinically and was discharged 5 days later to complete 2 months of triple therapy with Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Ethambutol followed by 4 months of maintenance therapy with Rifampicin and Isoniazid. He was planned to return for follow up with the infectious disease team.

 Here is the patient note:
A healthy 18-year-old male was admitted due to kidney failure (serum creatinine: 3 mg/dL), proteinuria (1.89 g/day), and recent past episodes of intermittent macrohematuria. Urine smear disclosed 30–50 red blood cells per high power field (). Four months before admission, a routine blood exam had been within normal limits, except for a urinalysis that had shown 10 red blood cells per high power field. Past medical history was negative for prior upper respiratory tract infections or any infections of clinical relevance. At the time of admission, physical examination was normal; blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg. A renal ultrasound showed kidneys with normal shape and measurements with echogenic alterations, while all complementary serologic studies were noncontributory: blood, urine, and throat cultures, HIV, hepatitis B and C serologies, complement levels, p- and c-ANCA antibodies, antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies, and electrophoretic proteinogram. Podocyturia was performed as described previously []. Briefly, the podocyte count was assessed by counting in urinary smears the number of cells in 10 microscopy fields of ×20. The podocyte count was 2.1 cells per ×20 field and the number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 166 (). Podocytes were identified by tagging synaptopodin (ab109560 Alexa Fluor®, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), an specific marker of podocytes, to establish their identity by immunofluorescence techniques using a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, Abcam, Cambridge, Uk). The smears were analyzed employing an epifluorescence microscopy, Nikon Eclipse E200. This result was compared with 10 controls (6 males and 4 females; mean age: 20 ± 2.1 years, with no past history of morbidities: serum creatinine, 0.7 ± 0.1 mg/dL; mean 24-hour urinary albumin excretion, 66 ± 12 mg/day. The mean podocyte count was 0.11 ± 0.3 cells per ×20 field, while the mean number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 8.3. One day after admission, a kidney biopsy was performed and was consistent with IgA nephropathy, with the following Oxford score over 14 glomeruli: M1E0S0T0. The immunofluorescence was positive for IgA and mesangial C3 deposits +++/4 y C3. Due to the rapidly progressive course of the altered kidney function, oral methyl prednisone 1 mg/kg/day was started. Two weeks later when creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL, amiloride was started at 5 mg/day. Four weeks after initiation of therapy, proteinuria and hematuria were negative and serum creatinine dropped to 0.7 mg/dL (). Two consecutive podocyturia tests were similar to controls after one year of follow-up. Current therapy consists of amiloride 5 mg/day and valsartan 80 mg/day.

Podocytes were identified by tagging synaptopodin (ab109560 Alexa Fluor®, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), an specific marker of podocytes, to establish their identity by immunofluorescence techniques using a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, Abcam, Cambridge, Uk). The smears were analyzed employing an epifluorescence microscopy, Nikon Eclipse E200. This result was compared with 10 controls (6 males and 4 females; mean age: 20 ± 2.1 years, with no past history of morbidities: serum creatinine, 0.7 ± 0.1 mg/dL; mean 24-hour urinary albumin excretion, 66 ± 12 mg/day. The mean podocyte count was 0.11 ± 0.3 cells per ×20 field, while the mean number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 8.3. One day after admission, a kidney biopsy was performed and was consistent with IgA nephropathy, with the following Oxford score over 14 glomeruli: M1E0S0T0. The immunofluorescence was positive for IgA and mesangial C3 deposits +++/4 y C3. Due to the rapidly progressive course of the altered kidney function, oral methyl prednisone 1 mg/kg/day was started. Two weeks later when creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL, amiloride was started at 5 mg/day. Four weeks after initiation of therapy, proteinuria and hematuria were negative and serum creatinine dropped to 0.7 mg/dL (). Two consecutive podocyturia tests were similar to controls after one year of follow-up. Current therapy consists of amiloride 5 mg/day and valsartan 80 mg/day.

 Here is the patient note:
A 64-year-old Brazilian man was admitted to the emergency department of our institution in April 2019 claiming fatigue, malaise, intermittent fever, and weight loss. In the first physical exam he presented hypotension and mental confusion. Three months before he began with progressive prostration, unintentional weight loss of 15 kg, intermittent fever, and night sweats. He was evaluated at an external hematology clinic 2 weeks before to come at our service and was diagnosed with multiple myeloma based on laboratory tests and bone marrow biopsy.
At initial physical examination, he had a temperature of 36.3 °C, a pulse of 81 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 incursions per minute, a peripheral oxygen saturation of 94% in ambient air, a blood pressure of 86/51 mmHg, and a slower peripheral perfusion (4 seconds). He had significant skin-mucous pallor, jaundice 2+/4+, lowered level of consciousness (Glasgow 14), mental confusion, and flapping in the upper extremities. The rest of the physical examination showed no other significant changes.
Initial laboratory evaluation revealed: hemoglobin (Hb) 9.7 g/L, hematocrit (Ht) 28.2%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 82.7 fl, white blood count (WBC) 3.02 × 109/L, neutrophils: 2.3 × 109/L, lymphocytes: 0.5 × 109/L, platelets: 39 × 109/L, Na++ 127 mEq/L, K+ 4.3 mEq/L, total Ca++ 9.3 mg/L, P 3.1 mg/L, creatinine 1.84 mg/dL, BUN 122 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 648 U/L, and C-protein reactive (CPR) 58.1 mg/L. Hepatic profile showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 258 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 213 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 386 U/L, gamma GT 473 U/L, total bilirubin: 2.95 mg dL (direct bilirubin [DB]: 2.29 /indirect bilirubin [IB]: 0.66), albumin 2.4 g/dL, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR): 1.27, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratio = 1.23. Laboratory evolution throughout hospitalization is summarized in Table .
In the emergency department, peripheral blood and urine cultures were collected and intravenous saline fluid and ceftriaxone was administered for treatment of supposed infectious etiologies. After initial measurements, blood pressure was normalized and the patient was stabilized. In his previous medical history, he had systemic arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure caused by recurrent nephrolithiasis. He used carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, spironolactone 25 mg once daily, ivabradine 5 mg twice daily, AAS 100 mg daily, and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily.
The patient had external laboratory tests showing 0.8 g/dL of monoclonal protein, IgA kappa paraprotein at serum immunofixation, serum IgA of 1038 mg/dL (70–400 mg/dL), and β2 microglobulin of 20.61 mg/L (0.8–2.2 mg/L). Bone marrow biopsy was hypercellular with monoclonal plasma cell proliferation CD56 (+), kappa light chain restriction, representing 30% of the total nucleated cells. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) Durie Salmon IIIA, ISS III was established in this moment.
Chest, abdomen, and pelvic computerized tomography (CT) revealed multiple lymphadenopathies up to 5.0 cm and splenomegaly. Positron emission CT with 18-fluoro deoxyglucose (18-FDG-PETCT) showed multiple lymphadenopathies in the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with SUVmax 12.0, liver FDG uptake 15.8 (SUVmax), and 16.4 cm splenomegaly with 15.8 spleen FDG uptake (Fig. ). Echocardiography was negative for endocarditis.
There was negativity for viral hepatitis B and C serology as well as for HIV, HTLV1, chickenpox, toxoplasmosis, herpes, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, enterovirus, paraecovirus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Blood cultures were negative. As the patient persisted with fever, ceftriaxone introduced at admission was replaced by Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Teicoplanin. However, the patient evolved quickly with multiorgan dysfunction characterized by liver and renal failure, LDH increase, and coagulopathy characterized by prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and factor V reduction keeping factor VIII level between the normal range values (Table ).
As the clinician suspected of concurrent HLH further tests showed serum ferritin level of 47.502 ng/mL (30–400 ng/mL) and slight elevation of triglycerides. A new bone marrow aspiration confirmed the presence of 21.6% of aberrant plasma cells with significant macrophage activity with several haemophagocytosis pictures (Fig. ). Immunophenotyping demonstrated 4.9% of anomalous and monoclonal plasma cells expressing CD45dim, CD19partial, CD38bright, CD138bright, CD56dim, CD117dim, and kappa light chain restriction in cytoplasm. Thereafter, the patient was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit and pulse therapy with methylprednisolone 1 g/d for 3 days was administered to control HLH. Afterwards the patient received cyclophosphamide at dose of 500 mg once weekly and dexamethasone 20 mg once daily D1–D4 as anti-multiple myeloma treatment. We were not able to investigate lymphadenopathy because the patient became soon hemodynamically unstable, requiring mechanical ventilation support and renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis. Unfortunately, the patient died 15 days after hospitalization.

Here is the task:
Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

First, we need to calculate the patient's serum creatinine level in mg/dL. The patient's serum creatinine level is given as 1.84 mg/dL. Then, we will use the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation to calculate the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m². The equation is: GFR = 141 × min(Scr/κ, 1)α × max(Scr/κ, 1)−1.209 × 0.993Age × 1.018 if female × 1.159 if black. We will plug in the patient's values and calculate the GFR.
{'Row Number': 40, 'Calculator Name': 'CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Calculator ID': '3', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-7523830-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 64-year-old Brazilian man was admitted to the emergency department of our institution in April 2019 claiming fatigue, malaise, intermittent fever, and weight loss. In the first physical exam he presented hypotension and mental confusion. Three months before he began with progressive prostration, unintentional weight loss of 15 kg, intermittent fever, and night sweats. He was evaluated at an external hematology clinic 2 weeks before to come at our service and was diagnosed with multiple myeloma based on laboratory tests and bone marrow biopsy.\nAt initial physical examination, he had a temperature of 36.3 °C, a pulse of 81 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 incursions per minute, a peripheral oxygen saturation of 94% in ambient air, a blood pressure of 86/51 mmHg, and a slower peripheral perfusion (4 seconds). He had significant skin-mucous pallor, jaundice 2+/4+, lowered level of consciousness (Glasgow 14), mental confusion, and flapping in the upper extremities. The rest of the physical examination showed no other significant changes.\nInitial laboratory evaluation revealed: hemoglobin (Hb) 9.7 g/L, hematocrit (Ht) 28.2%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 82.7 fl, white blood count (WBC) 3.02 × 109/L, neutrophils: 2.3 × 109/L, lymphocytes: 0.5 × 109/L, platelets: 39 × 109/L, Na++ 127 mEq/L, K+ 4.3 mEq/L, total Ca++ 9.3 mg/L, P 3.1 mg/L, creatinine 1.84 mg/dL, BUN 122 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 648 U/L, and C-protein reactive (CPR) 58.1 mg/L. Hepatic profile showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 258 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 213 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 386 U/L, gamma GT 473 U/L, total bilirubin: 2.95 mg dL (direct bilirubin [DB]: 2.29 /indirect bilirubin [IB]: 0.66), albumin 2.4 g/dL, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR): 1.27, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratio = 1.23. Laboratory evolution throughout hospitalization is summarized in Table .\nIn the emergency department, peripheral blood and urine cultures were collected and intravenous saline fluid and ceftriaxone was administered for treatment of supposed infectious etiologies. After initial measurements, blood pressure was normalized and the patient was stabilized. In his previous medical history, he had systemic arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure caused by recurrent nephrolithiasis. He used carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, spironolactone 25 mg once daily, ivabradine 5 mg twice daily, AAS 100 mg daily, and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily.\nThe patient had external laboratory tests showing 0.8 g/dL of monoclonal protein, IgA kappa paraprotein at serum immunofixation, serum IgA of 1038 mg/dL (70–400 mg/dL), and β2 microglobulin of 20.61 mg/L (0.8–2.2 mg/L). Bone marrow biopsy was hypercellular with monoclonal plasma cell proliferation CD56 (+), kappa light chain restriction, representing 30% of the total nucleated cells. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) Durie Salmon IIIA, ISS III was established in this moment.\nChest, abdomen, and pelvic computerized tomography (CT) revealed multiple lymphadenopathies up to 5.0 cm and splenomegaly. Positron emission CT with 18-fluoro deoxyglucose (18-FDG-PETCT) showed multiple lymphadenopathies in the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with SUVmax 12.0, liver FDG uptake 15.8 (SUVmax), and 16.4 cm splenomegaly with 15.8 spleen FDG uptake (Fig. ). Echocardiography was negative for endocarditis.\nThere was negativity for viral hepatitis B and C serology as well as for HIV, HTLV1, chickenpox, toxoplasmosis, herpes, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, enterovirus, paraecovirus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Blood cultures were negative. As the patient persisted with fever, ceftriaxone introduced at admission was replaced by Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Teicoplanin. However, the patient evolved quickly with multiorgan dysfunction characterized by liver and renal failure, LDH increase, and coagulopathy characterized by prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and factor V reduction keeping factor VIII level between the normal range values (Table ).\nAs the clinician suspected of concurrent HLH further tests showed serum ferritin level of 47.502 ng/mL (30–400 ng/mL) and slight elevation of triglycerides. A new bone marrow aspiration confirmed the presence of 21.6% of aberrant plasma cells with significant macrophage activity with several haemophagocytosis pictures (Fig. ). Immunophenotyping demonstrated 4.9% of anomalous and monoclonal plasma cells expressing CD45dim, CD19partial, CD38bright, CD138bright, CD56dim, CD117dim, and kappa light chain restriction in cytoplasm. Thereafter, the patient was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit and pulse therapy with methylprednisolone 1 g/d for 3 days was administered to control HLH. Afterwards the patient received cyclophosphamide at dose of 500 mg once weekly and dexamethasone 20 mg once daily D1–D4 as anti-multiple myeloma treatment. We were not able to investigate lymphadenopathy because the patient became soon hemodynamically unstable, requiring mechanical ventilation support and renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis. Unfortunately, the patient died 15 days after hospitalization.', 'Question': "Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?", 'LLM Answer': '24.4', 'LLM Explanation': "First, we need to calculate the patient's serum creatinine level in mg/dL.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 64 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.84 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.84/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**64 * 1.0 = 40.433.\nHence, the GFR value is 40.433 ml/min/1.73 m².", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Timestamp': '2025-06-17T00:45:50.567583', 'Unique_Identifier': 'calc_3_note_pmc-7523830-1_row_40'}

 Here is the patient note:
Our patient is a 38-year-old woman with a past medical history most significant for a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in March 2017, complicated by a marginal ulcer at the anastomosis site with subsequent perforation. The patient could not tolerate oral nutrition and became severely malnourished, and a PICC line was placed for TPN in December 2017. Chronic TPN use led to recurrent candidemia with blood cultures growing Candida albicans resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole. Over several months, her PICC line was replaced thrice, and she was ultimately treated with micafungin. The patient had multiple admissions over the past few months for workup of altered mental status and unsteady gait. Her other past medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus treated with mycophenolate mofetil and hydroxychloroquine, left portal vein branch thrombosis on enoxaparin therapy, type 2 diabetes mellitus not on insulin, fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety. She presented to our hospital in July 2018 with complaints of tremors, impaired mobility, confusion, gait instability, falls, and lethargy.
On admission, she was noted to be confused, with horizontal nystagmus and dilated pupils as well as bradypnea. Dilated fundus examination was indicative of candida retinitis. She was lethargic but arousable. Her speech was difficult to understand, and the history of presenting illness was provided primarily by the patient's mother who relayed to the team that she had been having tremors, episodes of confusion, and numerous falls for the past several months. Her mother also noticed that she had increased irritability and emotional lability during this time. She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit for airway management due to her acute encephalopathy. Due to a lack of meningeal signs, a lumbar puncture was not performed.
The infectious disease service was consulted, and she was started on liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine for a total of 6 weeks. MRI brain showed worsening T1 hyperintensities from June 2018 to July 2018 in the bilateral globus pallidi, as evidenced by the arrows in Figures and , which were thought to be secondary to manganese toxicity from chronic TPN use. Furthermore, a repeat MRI brain was performed in August 2018, one month after discontinuation of TPN, which showed improvement of the T1 hyperintensities in the bilateral globus pallidi, as evidenced by the white arrows in , approaching the intensity level noted in June 2018. Other supporting findings included T1 hyperintensities in the substantia nigra, as evidenced by the arrows in , and decreased signal in the bilateral globus pallidi on T2-weighted images, as evidenced by the arrows in . With antifungal treatment and cessation of TPN, her mentation and neurological symptoms improved within 3-4 days of cessation of TPN.
General surgery was consulted for gastrostomy tube placement in her remnant stomach, as the patient was unable to consume more than 500 calories by mouth per day due to complaints of nausea and vomiting. Although our patient presented to the hospital seven months after initiation of TPN therapy, her Parkinsonian symptoms had begun to manifest after three months on TPN.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with dizziness, disequilibrium, and dysarthria, which she had had for about 2 weeks. She had a history of hypertension, but no history of diabetes or heart disease, no familial history of cardiovascular disease, and no use of preventive medication for stroke.
On admission, her neurological examination was normal except for the presence of dysarthria, right central facial and glossary palsy, and bilateral positive Babinski signs.
Laboratory tests, including blood routine test, serum electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, blood sugar, coagulation profile, syphilis and HIV tests, and blood fat, were all normal. There were no abnormalities on her ECG, TEE, or 24-hour Holter monitoring.
DWI showed multiple high signal intensities in the territories of both anterior and posterior circulations. MR angiography showed no stenosis of large vessels. Her chest CT scan showed lung cancer and multiple metastases in the lungs.

To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to identify the patient's age, sex, and presence of certain medical conditions. From the patient note, we know the patient is a 68-year-old woman. We also know she has hypertension, which is a condition that contributes to the score. We do not know if she has diabetes, heart disease, or vascular disease, so we will assume these are not present. We also do not know if she has a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, so we will assume these are not present. Finally, we do not know if she has a history of vascular disease, so we will assume this is not present. With this information, we can calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score as follows: 1 point for age 65-74, 2 points for age 75 or older, 1 point for hypertension, 0 points for diabetes, heart disease, or vascular disease, 0 points for stroke or transient ischemic attack, and 0 points for vascular disease. Therefore, the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score is 3.

 Here is the patient note:
An 86-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and hypertension presented to the emergency department due to altered mental status. She was lethargic, confused, and was not answering questions appropriately for the past four days. On arrival, she was afebrile, and her vitals included a pulse of 139 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/79 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with saturation of 96% on room air. Physical exam was significant for a slow to respond female, orientated to self, who was able to follow commands with no focal neurological deficit. Her skin was warm and well-perfused with normal capillary refill, with no rashes or petechiae. The cardiovascular exam was significant for tachycardia, an irregular heart rhythm, and a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. She had lower extremity pitting edema bilaterally. Her lab results were notable for elevated white blood cell count (WBC) 25.2 x 103 μL (3.9-11.3 x 103 μL), hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL (11.3-15.1 g/dL), platelets 58.0 x 103 μL (165-366 x 103 μL), troponin 0.164 ng/mL (<0.010 ng/mL), lactic acid 2.5 mmol/L (0.5-2.0 mmol/L), and a basic chemistry panel was within normal limits. The urinalysis was remarkable for the presence of WBCs, leukocyte esterase, and bacteria with a urine culture pending. Additionally, two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Her electrocardiogram was significant for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate (RVR). She was started on ceftriaxone for probable UTI and was admitted to the hospital for further management. Further diagnostics included lower extremity Doppler ultrasound, which revealed deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A bedside echocardiogram indicated right ventricular strain, and the N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 8,215 pg/mL (<449 pg/mL). Due to concern for possible pulmonary embolism in the setting of known DVT, the patient was started on a continuous heparin infusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe aortic valve calcification with new aortic insufficiency. Blood and urine cultures returned positive for Aerococcus urinae. A transesophageal echocardiogram further confirmed moderate to severe aortic regurgitation with findings suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE), see Figures , .
Antibiotics were expanded to include gentamicin with ceftriaxone for IE, and surgical evaluation was consulted. Given she was a high-risk surgical candidate, surgery intervention was not offered at this time unless evidence of further clinical decompensation. Additional surgical recommendations included re-evaluation after completion of antibiotic course. She was therefore discharged on intravenous antibiotics to complete a total of six weeks of treatment with ceftriaxone and two weeks of gentamicin. Soon after completion, the patient returned due to worsening thrombocytopenia that had previously improved upon discharge. On readmission, repeat labs were most notable for worsening thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia. The patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR and physical exam concerning for decompensated heart failure. Despite administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and heart rate control, the patient continued to decline, and her clinical picture was consistent with cardiogenic shock. In addition to respiratory distress, the patient went into ventricular fibrillation arrest. Due to the patient's wishes to not be intubated or resuscitated, she was made comfortable and passed away.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old man with the left hemiparesis from 2 h previously visited the emergency room. His medical history included hypertension and bilateral emphysema due to heavy smoking. Vital sign assessment revealed tachycardia; examination of the heart revealed atrial fibrillation (AF). Neurological examination revealed left hemiparesis and mild disturbance of consciousness. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 12. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (diffusion-weighted image) showed right corona radiate infarction []. MR angiography (MRA) revealed right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion []. Chest X-ray showed no remarkable findings on admission. Initial investigations performed included a white blood cell (13.9 × 109/L; normal 4–11 × 109/L), hemoglobin (14.6 g/dL; normal 13.1–17.3 g/dL), and platelet (147 × 109/L; normal 130–400 × 109/L) count. Prothrombin time (16 s; normal 11.5–14.5 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (40.1 s; normal 27.5–41 s), D-dimer (<0.5 mg/mL; normal <0.5 mg/mL), arterial blood gas (room air; pH 7.35), PaO2 (89.0 mmHg), and PaCO2 (45.1 mmHg) were also analyzed. The patient was negative for antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody. Intravenous tPA was administered according to the accelerated regimen (0.6 mg/kg) 3.5 h after onset. Four hours later, consciousness gradually improved, the right MCA recanalized [], and volume of infarction was not changed. The patient experienced hemoptysis and mild shortness of breath 18 h later, with no chest pain or fever. Oxygen saturation dropped from 97 to 90%. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed multifocal diffuse ground-glass attenuation and patchy consolidation in both lungs [ and b]. Immediate chest X-ray revealed bilateral upper lobe intra-alveolar infiltrate []. The hemoptysis gradually improved after treatment with dopamine, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators, followed by fluid replacement, mechanical ventilation (MV), and administration of rFVIIa (75 mg/kg) with corticosteroids. The improvement was noted on day 3 and resolved completely by day 4. Hemoglobin dropped from 14.9 g/dl on admission to 11.7 g/dl on day 5, with no evidence of bleeding in other sites. Two weeks later, he was put off of the artificial respirator. After 1 month, the chest X-ray was normal []. He was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital after 6 weeks of hospitalization with modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 3.

To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to identify the patient's age, sex, and presence of certain medical conditions. From the patient note, we know the patient is a 68-year-old man, which means he has a score of 2 for age (1 point for each decade of age over 65). There is no mention of congestive heart failure, hypertension, or vascular disease, so those conditions do not contribute to the score. The patient has atrial fibrillation, which adds 2 points to the score. There is no mention of diabetes, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, or rheumatic heart disease, so those conditions do not contribute to the score. The patient has a history of smoking, which adds 1 point to the score. There is no mention of age 75 or older, so that does not contribute to the score. Finally, there is no mention of sex, so we assume the patient is male, which adds 1 point to the score. Therefore, the total CHA2DS2-VASc score is 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.

His medical history included hypertension and bilateral emphysema due to heavy smoking. Vital sign assessment revealed tachycardia; examination of the heart revealed atrial fibrillation (AF). Neurological examination revealed left hemiparesis and mild disturbance of consciousness. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 12. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (diffusion-weighted image) showed right corona radiate infarction []. MR angiography (MRA) revealed right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion []. Chest X-ray showed no remarkable findings on admission. Initial investigations performed included a white blood cell (13.9 × 109/L; normal 4–11 × 109/L), hemoglobin (14.6 g/dL; normal 13.1–17.3 g/dL), and platelet (147 × 109/L; normal 130–400 × 109/L) count. Prothrombin time (16 s; normal 11.5–14.5 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (40.1 s; normal 27.5–41 s), D-dimer (<0.5 mg/mL; normal <0.5 mg/mL), arterial blood gas (room air; pH 7.35), PaO2 (89.0 mmHg), and PaCO2 (45.1 mmHg) were also analyzed. The patient was negative for antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody. Intravenous tPA was administered according to the accelerated regimen (0.6 mg/kg) 3.5 h after onset. Four hours later, consciousness gradually improved, the right MCA recanalized [], and volume of infarction was not changed. The patient experienced hemoptysis and mild shortness of breath 18 h later, with no chest pain or fever. Oxygen saturation dropped from 97 to 90%. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed multifocal diffuse ground-glass attenuation and patchy consolidation in both lungs [ and b]. Immediate chest X-ray revealed bilateral upper lobe intra-alveolar infiltrate []. The hemoptysis gradually improved after treatment with dopamine, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators, followed by fluid replacement, mechanical ventilation (MV), and administration of rFVIIa (75 mg/kg) with corticosteroids. The improvement was noted on day 3 and resolved completely by day 4. Hemoglobin dropped from 14.9 g/dl on admission to 11.7 g/dl on day 5, with no evidence of bleeding in other sites. Two weeks later, he was put off of the artificial respirator. After 1 month, the chest X-ray was normal [].

 Here is the patient note:
The patient that admitted into our department was a 75-year-old male, diagnosed with osteoporosis by DXA examination, his serum CTX, P1NP and OC were 0.78 μg/L, 200.70 μg/L, and 24.47 μg/L, respectively. He had a history of 15-year hypertension and 10-year chronic AF. Ten months earlier, he suffered from abrupt dizziness accompanied with nausea and vomiting, right limb dysfunction when he went to the toilet at night. CT scans showed ‘the left basal ganglia infarction foci’. After that, warfarin sodium tablet was orally taken 3 mg/day. The patient's INR was 2.70 when he was admitted into our department. Alendronate sodium tablets were prescribed to the patient at 70 mg once a week. It turned out that the patient serum INR increased from 2.70 to 4.69 at the first 24 hours, the oral taken of alendronate sodium tablets was stopped immediately. Then the patient's serum INR fell to 4.34 at 48 hours; he also had spontaneous ecchymoses and petechiae in the skin during the fluctuation of INR. However, the ecchymoses and petechiae gradually vanished at the following days and INR decreased to 3.32 at the fifth day. The patients denied taken other medication except for warfarin sodium and alendronate sodium tablets, he also denied significant diet change.

 Here is the patient note:
A 56-year-old woman with a significant history of RCA stenosis with prior bare metal stenting, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented to the emergency department with anginal chest pain. Initial work up showed significant elevation of cardiac troponin T with T-wave inversion in the inferior leads. She subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed a 90% stenosis of the midportion of RCA with patent stent at distal portion of RCA (Figure , ) and only mild disease in left anterior descending coronary and left circumflex coronary arteries. An everolimus-eluting stent, 2.5 mm × 23 mm, was placed in the stenosis of midportion of RCA. Immediately after these interventions, thrombus developed and occluded SN artery. It originated from the proximal one third portion of RCA. Electrocardiographic monitoring showed junctional escape rhythm without P waves at a heart rate of 30 beats/min, suggesting sinus arrest (Figure ). To prevent severe bradycardia and hypotension, transvenous temporary pacemaker was placed. The patient remained asymptomatic and without hypotension. The clot in the SN artery was identified and thrombectomy was performed. Within five minutes after intervention, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow 3 was observed in the SN artery within 5 minutes and the transvenous temporary pacer was removed. Electrocardiogram revealed persistent junctional escape rhythm for 5 days after revascularization, with restoration of sinus rhythm on the sixth day. Heart rate showed a gradual improvement and the patient maintained a stable heart rate at 60 beats per minute. The patient remained hemodynamically stable without further need for temporary pacing. Pre-discharge exercise stress test had shown 50% predicted heart rate at 100 beats per minute, without ST segment change.

 Here is the patient note:
DH 21-year-old primigravida presented for her booking visit at 11+2/40. Her history was notable for a background history of congenital biliary atresia (BA). She had undergone an early Kasai portoenterostomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis in the early neonatal period. Her subsequent postoperative course was complicated by two episodes of cholangitis. By the age of two she had developed portal hypertension resulting in secondary thrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism. She had developed esophageal varices requiring annual sclerotherapy until the age of sixteen when she underwent variceal banding. Her vaccinations were up-to-date.
General findings on presentation at 11 weeks revealed icterus with scattered spider naevi. On abdominal inspection there was an upper abdominal scar from her prior surgery and on palpation the spleen was enlarged extending to below the level of the umbilicus; there was no evidence of ascites.
An ultrasound confirmed her estimated date of delivery. She was referred to the medical clinic at the hospital to provide a multidisciplinary team input to her care.
At sixteen weeks she developed an episode of cholangitis and she was treated with intravenous antibiotics for seven days. A liver ultrasound was performed. This revealed absence of intrahepatic dilatation with multiple periportal and peripancreatic varices and 14 cm splenomegaly. During the pregnancy her platelets remained low (29–55 × 109 L) and hemoglobin ranged from 8.8 to 10.5 g/dL. Her transaminases were marginally elevated (AST/ALT, 46/67) and coagulation parameters were normal. Significant concern remained about her thrombocytopenia and degree of hypersplenism.
A multidisciplinary meeting was convened with hepatology, hepatobiliary surgery, and interventional radiology. Concerns for this patient included her significant splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, risk of recurrent cholangitis, potential for massive variceal hemorrhage, and potential for preterm delivery, either spontaneous or iatrogenic. Abdominal delivery would also be compromised by large venous anastomoses in the anterior abdominal wall. A plan for management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage was outlined. Further imaging of her portal vessels was recommended as this would inform the interventional radiologists as to which was the optimum surgical intervention should bleeding develop from intraabdominal varices. The option of a splenectomy in pregnancy was excluded as this was deemed likely to cause portal vein thrombosis and would compromise any future candidacy for liver transplantation. At twenty weeks she underwent MR venography of the portal vessels. Her spleen measured 23 cm, there was evidence of extensive splenic and esophageal varices, and no lienorenal shunt was identified.
She had bimonthly antenatal visits with her obstetrical and hepatology teams. Her anatomy scan was within normal limits with a well-grown fetus on the 31st centile. Due to the complexity of the case and the potential for preterm delivery she received two doses of betamethasone at twenty-six weeks of gestation to aid lung maturation.
At 26+3 she presented to the maternity hospital with vaginal bleeding, suprapubic pressure, and uterine contractions for 24 hours with increasing intensity and duration. The fundal height was consistent with 26 weeks of pregnancy and cardiotocography was reassuring. Sterile speculum examination confirmed that the cervix was 5 cm dilated and fully effaced and the amniotic membranes were bulging through the cervix. A bedside ultrasound scan confirmed a breech presentation. Her platelet count was 33 × 109/L. Following consultation with perioperative medicine, the hepatobiliary team, and neonatology the decision was made to perform an emergency caesarean section. It had been planned to perform her surgery in a general hospital; however, due to the acute nature of her presentation the caesarean section was undertaken in the obstetric facility, with hepatobiliary surgery and interventional radiology on standby in the general hospital. Pooled platelets were administered immediately prior to surgery. Magnesium sulphate was administered to provide fetal neuroprotection. The caesarean section was performed via a vertical subumbilical incision, with a lower segment transverse incision on the uterus. The vertical incision was utilized both to provide greater access to the abdominal cavity should bleeding occur, either from the uterus or the varices, and to avoid large venous collaterals running vertically in the abdominal wall. A live male baby was delivered by breech extraction and transferred to the pediatric team following delayed cord clamping of 45 seconds. Apgar's scores were 61, 65, and 710; the cord blood gases were pH 7.27 (arterial) 7.29 (venous). The infant weighed 890 grams. The remainder of the surgery was uneventful. Perioperatively she received a further pooled platelet transfusion with good hemostasis and no transfusion of packed red cells was required. Her baby was transferred to intensive care and initially required CPAP. He had an uncomplicated neonatal course. Histology of the placenta was unremarkable. The patient had an uneventful postpartum course. She was advised against further pregnancies in view of her significant risks and underwent insertion of a levonorgestrel coil at three months postpartum for contraceptive purposes and she is currently awaiting liver transplantation. Despite the premature gestational age, the infant had an essentially uneventful postnatal course. He was discharged home at ten weeks of age and as a one-year-old boy he has met all his expected developmental milestones.

To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to identify the patient's history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, and sex. From the patient note, we can see that the patient has no history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or vascular disease. The patient is 21 years old, which is less than 65 years old, so we don't need to consider the age factor. The patient is a female, so we need to add 1 point for being female. The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which is not a factor in the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Therefore, the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score is 1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 75-year-old man with persistent AF, a CHA2DS2 VASc score of 4 and a HAS-BLED score of 4 with recurrent gastrointestinal bleedings was referred to a tertiary clinic for a LAAC. His medical history consisted of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and a two-thirds gastric resection performed in the 1980s. The intervention was successfully performed with an ABBOTT® Amulet 18 mm device being implanted (). After the implantation, he received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and Clopidogrel for 6 months. Approximately 5 months post-intervention, the patient expressed acute dyspnoea and called the emergency medical services (EMS).
On arrival of the EMS, the patient was conscious, severely distressed and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg and a heart rate of 90/min. Peripheral oxygen saturation of 85% measured percutaneously was noted. After the administration of bronchodilator medication for a presumed COPD exacerbation, the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated with a resultant cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity. The patient received cardiopulmonary resuscitation including chest compressions, endotracheal intubation, and the administration of 3 mg Adrenaline. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred approximately 10 min later at which point he was transferred to a local hospital. During the transport, the cardiocirculatory parameters were relatively stable with a systolic pressure around 100 mmHg. The capnometry after return of spontaneous circulation measured a pCO2 of 60 mmHg. Upon arrival at the hospital, the physical examination showed jugular vein distension but no peripheral oedema.
Echocardiography performed in the emergency department revealed a pericardial tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis via the subxiphoidal route, 800 mL of blood were initially evacuated. The differential diagnosis included primary respiratory failure or a sudden cardiac death with secondary pericardial effusion induced by cardiac compressions under double antiplatelet therapy, a ruptured aortic aneurysm, a myocardial rupture, or a primary laceration of a cardiac structure by the LAA occluder. A ruptured aneurysm of the ascending aorta was excluded by ultrasound. Electrocardiogram examination did not demonstrate any ST-segment elevation or low voltage. Blood gas analysis documented a stable respiratory situation with a pO2 of 230 mmHg and a pCO2 of 55 mmHg, the pH was 7, 3 and Lactate elevated with 10 mmol/L (<2 mmol/L). The haemoglobin was measured at 9 g/dL (12–16 g/dL). The chest X-ray demonstrated the proper placement of the endotracheal and pericardial tube and ruled out a pneumothorax or pulmonary oedema.
In the hours following pericardiocentesis, approximately 2 L of blood were evacuated. Conventional methods of coagulopathy management including application of tranexamic acid, fresh frozen plasma, and fibrinogen did not stop the bleeding. To stabilize the patient a total of eight packs of red blood cells were transfused.
In preparation of cardiac surgery, a coronary angiogram was performed (). It revealed active leakage of contrast agent in the proximal circumflex artery and the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery department immediately. Intra-operatively a perforation of the tissue at the basis of the LAA close to the left main coronary artery was discovered. Under protection of cold blood cardioplegia on cardiopulmonary bypass the occluder was excised through the opened left atrium. The LAA was closed by endocardial sutures and two pledget sutures were used to seal the epicardial lesion at the LAA basis which stopped the bleeding. Fortunately, after prolonged treatment in the intensive care unit and weaning ward the patient was discharged and alive 4 months after the event without neurological deficit and on ASA monotherapy. Transthoracic echocardiogram in the weaning ward ruled out a persistent pericardial effusion.

The patient note mentions that the patient has a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4. This score is calculated based on the patient's medical history, which includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and a two-thirds gastric resection performed in the 1980s. The score is calculated by assigning points for each of these conditions, with a maximum score of 9. The patient's score is 4, which is mentioned in the patient note.
{'Row Number': 48, 'Calculator Name': 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'Calculator ID': '4', 'Category': 'risk', 'Note ID': 'pmc-6939804-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 75-year-old man with persistent AF, a CHA2DS2 VASc score of 4 and a HAS-BLED score of 4 with recurrent gastrointestinal bleedings was referred to a tertiary clinic for a LAAC. His medical history consisted of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and a two-thirds gastric resection performed in the 1980s. The intervention was successfully performed with an ABBOTT® Amulet 18 mm device being implanted (). After the implantation, he received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and Clopidogrel for 6 months. Approximately 5 months post-intervention, the patient expressed acute dyspnoea and called the emergency medical services (EMS).\nOn arrival of the EMS, the patient was conscious, severely distressed and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg and a heart rate of 90/min. Peripheral oxygen saturation of 85% measured percutaneously was noted. After the administration of bronchodilator medication for a presumed COPD exacerbation, the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated with a resultant cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity. The patient received cardiopulmonary resuscitation including chest compressions, endotracheal intubation, and the administration of 3 mg Adrenaline. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred approximately 10 min later at which point he was transferred to a local hospital. During the transport, the cardiocirculatory parameters were relatively stable with a systolic pressure around 100 mmHg. The capnometry after return of spontaneous circulation measured a pCO2 of 60 mmHg. Upon arrival at the hospital, the physical examination showed jugular vein distension but no peripheral oedema.\nEchocardiography performed in the emergency department revealed a pericardial tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis via the subxiphoidal route, 800 mL of blood were initially evacuated. The differential diagnosis included primary respiratory failure or a sudden cardiac death with secondary pericardial effusion induced by cardiac compressions under double antiplatelet therapy, a ruptured aortic aneurysm, a myocardial rupture, or a primary laceration of a cardiac structure by the LAA occluder. A ruptured aneurysm of the ascending aorta was excluded by ultrasound. Electrocardiogram examination did not demonstrate any ST-segment elevation or low voltage. Blood gas analysis documented a stable respiratory situation with a pO2 of 230 mmHg and a pCO2 of 55 mmHg, the pH was 7, 3 and Lactate elevated with 10 mmol/L (<2 mmol/L). The haemoglobin was measured at 9 g/dL (12–16 g/dL). The chest X-ray demonstrated the proper placement of the endotracheal and pericardial tube and ruled out a pneumothorax or pulmonary oedema.\nIn the hours following pericardiocentesis, approximately 2 L of blood were evacuated. Conventional methods of coagulopathy management including application of tranexamic acid, fresh frozen plasma, and fibrinogen did not stop the bleeding. To stabilize the patient a total of eight packs of red blood cells were transfused.\nIn preparation of cardiac surgery, a coronary angiogram was performed (). It revealed active leakage of contrast agent in the proximal circumflex artery and the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery department immediately. Intra-operatively a perforation of the tissue at the basis of the LAA close to the left main coronary artery was discovered. Under protection of cold blood cardioplegia on cardiopulmonary bypass the occluder was excised through the opened left atrium. The LAA was closed by endocardial sutures and two pledget sutures were used to seal the epicardial lesion at the LAA basis which stopped the bleeding. Fortunately, after prolonged treatment in the intensive care unit and weaning ward the patient was discharged and alive 4 months after the event without neurological deficit and on ASA monotherapy. Transthoracic echocardiogram in the weaning ward ruled out a persistent pericardial effusion.', 'Question': "What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?", 'LLM Answer': '4', 'LLM Explanation': "The patient note mentions that the patient has a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4.

Because the patient has congestive heart failure, one point is added to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe patient history for hypertension is absent. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 3.\nOne criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Because tia history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because thromboembolism history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3.\nBased on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is present. Because the patient has vascular disease, one point is added to the score, making the current total 3 + 1 = 4. Because diabetes history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it's value as 'absent'. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 4.\nThe patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 4.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Timestamp': '2025-06-17T00:48:20.019779', 'Unique_Identifier': 'calc_4_note_pmc-6939804-1_row_48', 'Attention_Analysis_Directory': 'attention_results/calc_4_note_pmc-6939804-1_row_48', 'Attention_Files_Generated': ['essential_data']}

 Here is the patient note:
A 90-year-old African American female with a history of type 2 diabetes, essential hypertension, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and atrial flutter on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban presented for new-onset general tonic-clonic seizures, witnessed by her family. The patient had been bed-bound from arthritis in a nursing home, but her mental status had been intact. The patient had recently been hospitalized over 3 weeks ago for COVID-19 pneumonia and was discharged home with home hospice one week before readmission.
According to her family, the patient's mental status had severely declined during her previous hospitalization with COVID-19. She developed staring spells after discharge that culminated into generalized tonic-clonic seizures on the day of the current admission. The episode lasted two seconds. Per her hospice nurse, blood pressures and blood glucose were well controlled at home. The home medications were thoroughly reviewed and found not to have any typical pharmacologic culprits. When she presented to the emergency department, she had two more witnessed seizures. Her blood pressure during this episode was 227/95 mm Hg, her heart rate was 98 beats/min, the temperature was 36.7°C, her respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 93% while she breathed room air. Intravenous labetalol, lorazepam, and levetiracetam were administered. Her blood pressure decreased to 160/70 mm Hg and remained well controlled during her hospitalization. Head CT and basic laboratory work () were unremarkable. Her physical exam was notable for postictal confusion. She was alert and only oriented to person. An electroencephalogram (EEG) detected no evidence of seizure or epileptiform discharges, but generalized slowing with an intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral temporal regions was noticed (). Brain MRI demonstrated subcortical and cortical FLAIR signal abnormality involving the left greater than right parieto-occipital lobes and the left temporal lobe, in a pattern most compatible with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (Figures –). There was no acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.
The patient had no further seizures after being treated with levetiracetam. Her mental state gradually returned to normal. She became more eager to participate in physical therapy and be more independent. She set a goal to walk without her walker and to cook for her family and friends. Her family was pleasantly surprised by this improvement in her mentation. She had no further seizure activity in the hospital and was discharged back home with home care services. She is doing well six months after discharge, is seizure-free, and follows her scheduled appointments. Follow-up MRI four months later after presentation showed complete or near resolution of the lesions (Figures –).
No written consent has been obtained from the patient as there is no patient identifiable data included in the case report.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to evaluate the patient's age, sex, and presence of certain medical conditions. The patient is 55 years old, which is a risk factor. We also need to consider the presence of hypertension, heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, vascular disease, age 65-74, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's vital signs and physical examination are within normal limits, so we can assume no hypertension, heart failure, or left ventricular dysfunction. The patient's ECG shows normal sinus rhythm, and there is no mention of vascular disease, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or chronic kidney disease. Therefore, we can assign 0 points for these conditions. The patient has a history of syncopal episodes, which may be related to his pacemaker, but this is not a condition that is included in the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Finally, we can assign 2 points for the patient's age (65-74) and 1 point for being male, for a total score of 3.
{'Row Number': 50, 'Calculator Name': 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'Calculator ID': '4', 'Category': 'risk', 'Note ID': 'pmc-4369977-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.\nHe had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.\nThe patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).\nCardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device.

 Here is the patient note:
A 63-year-old man with history of hypertension and glucose intolerance since age 59 years was emergently admitted to our Institution from a peripheral Hospital for evaluation of a severe, constant posterior chest pain, radiating forward, and dyspnoea with a suspected diagnosis of acute aortic dissection.
On physical examination the patient was not shocked, his pulse was 87 beats/min, blood pressure 150/105 mmHg. He had truncal obesity, a "moon face" and proximal muscle weakness. An electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy. His laboratory work-up revealed anaemia (Hb 10.7 g/dl), hypokaliemia (3.4 mEq/L), metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 35 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemia (170 mg/dl). A CT scan of thorax and abdomen demonstrated a dissection starting just below left succlavian artery and extending downward to the left renal artery, involving the celiac tripod and superior mesenteric artery (). The dissection was classified as Stanford B, De Bakey III. Moreover CT scan of abdomen revealed incidentally a left adrenal tumour of 25 mm of diameter.
The patient was pharmacologically treated and was felt at risk for impending aortic rupture. Therefore, an emergent endograft positioning was planned. Our goal was to exclude the damaged segment of the aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and at the secondary tears along the vessel). Through an inguinal incision, the right common, superficial and profunda femoral artery were dissected free. A prosthetic graft (Valiant, Medtronic, Sunnyvale, CA, USA 42 mm x 198 mm) was placed just below the origin of the left succlavian artery up to the diaphragmatic hiatus. A postoperative control CT scan demonstrated the correct graft positioning, not endoleaks and the closure of all secondary tears ().
This patient was evaluated for hypercortisolism and the plasma cortisol was increased to 33.9 μg/dl (vn, value of normal, 5.6-23 μg/dl) without circadian rhythm and not suppressed by the administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone (overnight text: 9.8 μg/dl; vn <1.8 μg/dl ). The plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was less than 10 pg/ml (vn 12-60 pg/ml) and 24h urinary free cortisol excretion (UFC) was elevated 465.6 μg/24 h (vn 26-135 μg/24h ).
A MRI of abdomen was performed to have a more accurate evaluation of the adrenal mass, it was of 2 cm of diameter, well capsulated, hyperintense in T1 sequences with a normal reduction of signal in T2 weighted sequences ().
A diagnosis of CS was made on basis of the endocrinological tests and for the presence of left adrenocortical lesion. Via laparotomic approach, a left adrenalectomy was performed during intravenous replacement of hydrocortisone, ACE-inhibitor, aspirin and insulin therapy.
Six months after adrenalectomy, blood pressure was controlled (135/75 mmHg) with anti-hypertensive therapy, laboratory analysis revealed glycaemia 102 mg/dl, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 5.7%, potassium 4.26 mEq/l, sodium 139.7 mEq/L, plasma creatinine 1.05 g/dl, a.m. plasma cortiso l9.7 μg/dl, plasma ACTH 28 pg/ml and UFC 45 μg/24h.

 Here is the patient note:
A 59-year-old man diagnosed with obstructive hydrocephalus was scheduled for an ETV. The patient had a medical history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension that was being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a beta blocker. The body mass index was 33.8, but he had no respiratory symptoms, including sleep apnea. A preoperative chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but electrocardiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. The patient's symptoms were amnesia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence that had persisted for 5 months; preoperatively, he was alert and cooperative and had no problem communicating. The preoperative vital signs were: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 59 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 96%. Since the appearance of the patient suggested a possible difficult intubation, a video laryngoscope was used for tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia with 150 mg propofol 1%, 40 mg lidocaine 2%, and 60 mg rocuronium. The vocal cord was clearly visible on the video laryngoscope and the intubation was accomplished without trauma or other difficulties. Anesthesia was maintained with 5% desflurane and 0.02 µg/kg/min remifentanil, and air with 50% oxygen. The surgery lasted 2 hours and required no additional muscle relaxants. During the surgery, there was sudden and sustained hypotension (mean blood pressure 52–57 mmHg) with bradycardia (heart rate 45–55 beats/min) that did not respond well to ephedrine; these complications began about 10 min after the beginning of the surgery and lasted for 25 min until a dopamine infusion was administered that restored normal blood pressure. Remifentanil infusion was discontinued at the onset of hypotension and bradycardia. After the purge of volatile agents at the end of the surgery, the train of four (TOF) count was 4, and the ratio was 50%, so 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected. The patient recovered muscle power within a few minutes, showing firm hand grip, head elevation, and mouth opening, and was fully obeying verbal commands, but was not opening his eyes. As he was alert and cooperative at that point and no other neurologic deficit was observed, the neurosurgeons thought that the inability to open his eyes was not related to the surgery. We relieved the bandage on the head in order to reduce the chance of unintended pressure or tension on the forehead, and suggested that further neurologic examinations be done after full recovery from anesthesia. Spontaneous respiration was present, showing expired tidal volumes reaching 500 ml each time, but was tachypneic; the patient's respiratory rate ranged from 40 to 50 breaths/min. This condition continued for 5 min, at which time the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU under mask ventilation. The patient showed signs of inspiratory stridor, chest retractions, and hoarse voice after the extubation. The patient's accessory respiratory muscles were not involved in the hyperventilation. There was no crackle or wheezing clear on auscultation besides the inspiratory stridor, but the findings were not clear on account of the hoarse voice and the rapid and dynamic ventilation. An additional 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected in the PACU under the theory that the patient's upper airway was obstructed because of possible residual paralysis but the condition did not change. The patient was fully responsive to verbal commands but was still unable to open his eyes or hold his breath and he complained of feeling like he was choking despite the hyperventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) at that point showed: pH, 7.35; pCO2, 37 mmHg; pO2, 76 mmHg; HCO3, 20.4 mmol/L; and O2 saturation, 94%. The vital signs at that point were: blood pressure, 150/90 mmHg; heart rate, 110 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 44 breaths/min. Since tachypnea (40–50 breaths/min) persisted for 20 min in the PACU and oxygen saturation started to drop under 95%, 200 mg thiopental sodium and 100 mg succinylcholine were injected and endotracheal intubation was performed. Endotracheal suction was done immediately after intubation and there was no sputum or discharge. Auscultation right after the re-intubation sounded smooth, without crackle or wheezing, and the oxygen saturation rapidly corrected to 100%. Tachypnea persisted even under sedation after the succinylcholine wore off, so a central cause was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive pneumocephalus with pneumoventricle and hydrocephalus (). A chest X-ray taken after the brain CT showed no pathologic findings such as pulmonary edema, congestion, or pneumothorax. On the neurosurgeon's recommendation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was kept there for three days under mechanical ventilation with sedation with midazolam, cisatracurium, and rocuronium until the pneumocephalus and tachypnea spontaneously resolved. Follow-up chest radiographs were taken over the next 3 weeks and showed nothing abnormal. According to a pulmonology consultation, the tachypnea was not likely to have originated from pulmonary problems. ABGA results stayed within normal limits under fully controlled mechanical ventilation but showed hypoxemia when the patient gained spontaneous respiration during the sedative period before the resolution of the pneumocephalus. Since the follow-up chest X-rays showed no abnormal findings, pulmonary embolism evaluation including embolism CT and laboratory examinations, which also showed nothing abnormal, were done on the recommendation of a pulmonologist. When a follow-up brain CT showed resolution of the pneumocephalus on the 3rd day after the surgery, sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents were discontinued and the mechanical ventilation mode was switched to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The respiratory rate at that point ranged from 15 to 20 breaths/min and ABGA results remained normal when the patient gained consciousness and self-respiration, so the endotracheal tube was extubated. The patient is now (30 days post-operation) in the general ward; he is mentally alert and has stable vital signs but still is unable to open his eyes because of bilateral ptosis and is receiving conservative treatment.

Anesthesia was maintained with 5% desflurane and 0.02 µg/kg/min remifentanil, and air with 50% oxygen. The surgery lasted 2 hours and required no additional muscle relaxants. During the surgery, there was sudden and sustained hypotension (mean blood pressure 52–57 mmHg) with bradycardia (heart rate 45–55 beats/min) that did not respond well to ephedrine; these complications began about 10 min after the beginning of the surgery and lasted for 25 min until a dopamine infusion was administered that restored normal blood pressure. Remifentanil infusion was discontinued at the onset of hypotension and bradycardia. After the purge of volatile agents at the end of the surgery, the train of four (TOF) count was 4, and the ratio was 50%, so 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected. The patient recovered muscle power within a few minutes, showing firm hand grip, head elevation, and mouth opening, and was fully obeying verbal commands, but was not opening his eyes. As he was alert and cooperative at that point and no other neurologic deficit was observed, the neurosurgeons thought that the inability to open his eyes was not related to the surgery. We relieved the bandage on the head in order to reduce the chance of unintended pressure or tension on the forehead, and suggested that further neurologic examinations be done after full recovery from anesthesia. Spontaneous respiration was present, showing expired tidal volumes reaching 500 ml each time, but was tachypneic; the patient's respiratory rate ranged from 40 to 50 breaths/min. This condition continued for 5 min, at which time the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU under mask ventilation. The patient showed signs of inspiratory stridor, chest retractions, and hoarse voice after the extubation. The patient's accessory respiratory muscles were not involved in the hyperventilation. There was no crackle or wheezing clear on auscultation besides the inspiratory stridor, but the findings were not clear on account of the hoarse voice and the rapid and dynamic ventilation. An additional 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected in the PACU under the theory that the patient's upper airway was obstructed because of possible residual paralysis but the condition did not change. The patient was fully responsive to verbal commands but was still unable to open his eyes or hold his breath and he complained of feeling like he was choking despite the hyperventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) at that point showed: pH, 7.35; pCO2, 37 mmHg; pO2, 76 mmHg; HCO3, 20.4 mmol/L; and O2 saturation, 94%. The vital signs at that point were: blood pressure, 150/90 mmHg; heart rate, 110 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 44 breaths/min. Since tachypnea (40–50 breaths/min) persisted for 20 min in the PACU and oxygen saturation started to drop under 95%, 200 mg thiopental sodium and 100 mg succinylcholine were injected and endotracheal intubation was performed. Endotracheal suction was done immediately after intubation and there was no sputum or discharge. Auscultation right after the re-intubation sounded smooth, without crackle or wheezing, and the oxygen saturation rapidly corrected to 100%. Tachypnea persisted even under sedation after the succinylcholine wore off, so a central cause was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive pneumocephalus with pneumoventricle and hydrocephalus (). A chest X-ray taken after the brain CT showed no pathologic findings such as pulmonary edema, congestion, or pneumothorax. On the neurosurgeon's recommendation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was kept there for three days under mechanical ventilation with sedation with midazolam, cisatracurium, and rocuronium until the pneumocephalus and tachypnea spontaneously resolved. Follow-up chest radiographs were taken over the next 3 weeks and showed nothing abnormal. According to a pulmonology consultation, the tachypnea was not likely to have originated from pulmonary problems. ABGA results stayed within normal limits under fully controlled mechanical ventilation but showed hypoxemia when the patient gained spontaneous respiration during the sedative period before the resolution of the pneumocephalus. Since the follow-up chest X-rays showed no abnormal findings, pulmonary embolism evaluation including embolism CT and laboratory examinations, which also showed nothing abnormal, were done on the recommendation of a pulmonologist. When a follow-up brain CT showed resolution of the pneumocephalus on the 3rd day after the surgery, sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents were discontinued and the mechanical ventilation mode was switched to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The respiratory rate at that point ranged from 15 to 20 breaths/min and ABGA results remained normal when the patient gained consciousness and self-respiration, so the endotracheal tube was extubated. The patient is now (30 days post-operation) in the general ward; he is mentally alert and has stable vital signs but still is unable to open his eyes because of bilateral ptosis and is receiving conservative treatment. Here is the task: What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|> Here is the output: { "step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to identify the patient's history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, and sex.

To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to identify the patient's history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, and sex. From the patient note, we can extract the following information: the patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension, which is being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a beta blocker. The patient is 59 years old, which falls within the high-risk age range. The patient has a body mass index of 33.8, which is classified as obese. The patient has no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, or atrial fibrillation. The patient is male, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we can calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score as follows: 1 point for hypertension, 2 points for age (59-64), 1 point for diabetes, and 1 point for sex (male). The total score is 5.

The patient had a medical history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension that was being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a beta blocker. The body mass index was 33.8, but he had no respiratory symptoms, including sleep apnea. A preoperative chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but electrocardiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. The patient's symptoms were amnesia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence that had persisted for 5 months; preoperatively, he was alert and cooperative and had no problem communicating.

 Here is the patient note:
A 78-year-old female patient, temporarily admitted to the recovery department after ECT, developed atrial fibrillation and chest pain. Her medical history showed hypertension, severe depression and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Her ECG 3 months before ECT was completely normal. Immediately after ECT her blood pressure was 230/140 mmHg, but later decreased to 110/45 mmHg. Examination of heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 140 beats/min and new negative T waves in leads I, II, aVL and V2-6. The second ECG showed sinus rhythm and persisting negative T-waves (Fig. ). Troponin T level was 0.02 μg/l (normal) and no other laboratory abnormalities were found. A differential diagnosis was made and the following possible causes were taken into account: post ECT, post tachycardia due to atrial fibrillation, severe hypertension or myocardial ischaemia. Since the patient reported to have had previous anginal complaints, coronary angiography was performed. In the left anterior descending artery two significant stenoses were identified in the proximal and the mid section, respectively. Furthermore, a stenosis was found in the right coronary artery. Due to her psychiatric condition, PCI was not performed and she was treated with anti-anginal medication and warfarin.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient was a 64-year-old man affected by a persistent nodular lesion of the cheek mucosa. More precisely, he presented with a blue-violet, sessile, painless, and nonbleeding lesion of the cheek lasting one year (Figure ). He reported occasional biting trauma. Warfarin therapy had been prescribed for the patient for chronic atrial fibrillation. The clinical diagnosis was of venous malformation, as confirmed by ultrasound investigation. Following a careful explanation of the treatment, the patient agreed to transmucosal photocoagulation by DL without suspension of warfarin treatment. After a small amount of local anesthesia, we used the DL (wavelength 910 ± 10 nm; pulsed-wave; fiber of 400 microns; output energy 5 W) to directly photocoagulate the lesion, and the treatment ended when its color varied from blue-violet to grayish-white (Figure ). The irradiated area healed in 14 days without recurrence (Figure ).

 Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old man who had alcoholic liver disease and chronic hepatitis C-related Child-Pugh class C liver cirrhosis was brought to our emergency department by ambulance, exhibiting fever, short of breath and a localized wound pain over left ankle. The patient presented with dyspnea, lower extremity edema and some wounds over bilateral ankles area for 1 day before admission, but had no other symptoms, including a headache, sore throat, cough, and chest, abdominal, and back pain. He had alcohol and chronic hepatitis C- related liver cirrhosis, and took diuretics in the past 5 years. He drank approximately 60 g of alcohol per day for more than 20 years, but recently had been taking a bit more than usual.
His laboratory data 2 weeks before admission were 6.5 mg/ dl of total bilirubin, 2.1 g/dl of albumin, and 1.73 of international normalized ratio. In addition, he had moderate ascites, which was medically controlled. These findings were indicative of Child- Pugh class C liver cirrhosis. On arrival, he appeared to be in disturbance and distress that was classified as 13 (E3V4M6) on the Glasgow Coma Scale. His vital signs were 132/106 mmHg of blood pressure, 125 beats/minute of pulse rate, 24 breaths/minute of respiratory rate, and 38.4 °C of body temperature. Auscultation of the lung and heart revealed coarse breath sounds and rapid irregular heartbeats. His abdomen was soft and swollen. Two wounds with redness and swelling (measures 0.5 × 0.5 cm, left ankle; measures 1 × 1 cm, right ankle) were found on his lower extremities ( and ). Chest X-ray indicated a lower lobe infiltration and a mild blunting of C-P angle in the right side (). ECG showed atrial fibrillation.
Laboratory findings also included 8,990/ml of white blood cell count with 94% neutrophils and 3% lymphocytes, 11.1 g/dl of hemoglobin level, 104,000/ml of platelet count, 23 mg/dl of blood urea nitrogen, 1.42 mg/dl of creatinine, 121 mmol/L of sodium, and 4.6 mmol/L of potassium. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrated 152 cells/mm3 of ascitic white blood cell count and 30 cells/mm3 of polymorphonuclear cell count 10 hours later after his arrival of emergency department. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated a severe metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.38, pCO2: 20.4 mmHg, pO2: 91.8 mmHg; base deficit: 11.2 mmol/L), which was indicative of septic shock.
Oxacillin treatment under the impression of cellulitis was administered 2 hours after his arrival; two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Rapid fluid resuscitation was performed and immediately developed by tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Although there was no significant change of ankle wounds, antibiotic regimen with a combination of ceftriaxone and clindamycin was adjusted due to persistent hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation and high dose vasopressor use and clinical suspicion of Vibrio vulnificus related necrotizing fasciitis.
One episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with manifestations of fresh blood in the nasogastric tube occurred on Day 2. Blood transfusion with 2 units of packed red blood cells was given. Despite intensive support efforts, the patient died on Day 3 after the sudden change. And after that, his blood and ascites cultures were positive for A. hydrophila.

 Here is the patient note:
A 62-year-old male presented to Samsung Medical Center with a 40-year history of paroxysmal palpitations. Although diagnosed with atrial septal defect (ASD) 30 years previously, the patient elected not to undergo surgical repair. Approximately 1 year prior, he began to visit the pediatric ward of Samsung Medical Center more frequently with symptoms of palpitations and dyspnea lasting 2 to 3 days and occurring in 2- to 3-month intervals. An electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and secundum-type ASD (22.3 mm) with a left-to-right shunt was diagnosed by echocardiogram. Device closure (Amplatzer septal occlude 28 mm; AGA Medical, Golden Valley, MN, USA) was then performed; however, 1 week after the procedure, the patient continued to experience dyspnea and chest pain after 10 to 20 minutes of walking. Sustained atrial fibrillation was seen on the electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. Cardioversion was performed following hospitalization with the opinion that the persistent atrial fibrillation was due to device closure. The patient was discharged from the hospital after cardioversion to sinus rhythm at 100 J; however, the symptoms recurred. Since it was difficult to perform radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) due to the recent device closure, the patient was referred to the thoracic surgery department for totally thoracoscopic ablation. Surgery was performed under routine procedures. Intubation was performed using a double lumen endotracheal tube. For the surgery, a 10-mm trocar was inserted in the fourth intercostal space (ICS) of the right anterior axillary line, a 5-mm trocar in the third ICS along the anterior axillary line, and a 10-mm trocar in the sixth ICS on the mid-axillary line. Right pulmonary vein ablation, right ganglionated plexi ablation, and ablation of the right half of the space between the right lower pulmonary vein and the left lower pulmonary vein were performed. Between the procedures, we conducted a high-frequency stimulation test for finding ganglionated plexi. Sutures were placed after chest tube insertion. On the left side, ports were placed in the same positions, and ablations were performed in the same order as on the right side after dividing Marshall’s ligament (). A left atrial auricle resection was then performed using an Echelon Flex 60 articulating endoscopic linear cutter (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). Upon confirmation of the conversion to sinus rhythm, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. He was then transferred to the general ward on postoperative day 1 and discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 6. During this 6-day postoperative period, the sinus rhythm was maintained continuously. Six months later, the sinus rhythm was seen on the 24-hour Holter monitor; the patient showed none of the earlier symptoms, and therefore, amiodarone and warfarin were stopped. The patient is currently being followed as an outpatient, and his sinus rhythm has been well maintained as seen on the last electrocardiogram at the 8 month follow-up.

Although diagnosed with atrial septal defect (ASD) 30 years previously, the patient elected not to undergo surgical repair. Approximately 1 year prior, he began to visit the pediatric ward of Samsung Medical Center more frequently with symptoms of palpitations and dyspnea lasting 2 to 3 days and occurring in 2- to 3-month intervals. An electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and secundum-type ASD (22.3 mm) with a left-to-right shunt was diagnosed by echocardiogram. Device closure (Amplatzer septal occlude 28 mm; AGA Medical, Golden Valley, MN, USA) was then performed; however, 1 week after the procedure, the patient continued to experience dyspnea and chest pain after 10 to 20 minutes of walking. Sustained atrial fibrillation was seen on the electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. Cardioversion was performed following hospitalization with the opinion that the persistent atrial fibrillation was due to device closure. The patient was discharged from the hospital after cardioversion to sinus rhythm at 100 J; however, the symptoms recurred. Since it was difficult to perform radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) due to the recent device closure, the patient was referred to the thoracic surgery department for totally thoracoscopic ablation. Surgery was performed under routine procedures. Intubation was performed using a double lumen endotracheal tube. For the surgery, a 10-mm trocar was inserted in the fourth intercostal space (ICS) of the right anterior axillary line, a 5-mm trocar in the third ICS along the anterior axillary line, and a 10-mm trocar in the sixth ICS on the mid-axillary line. Right pulmonary vein ablation, right ganglionated plexi ablation, and ablation of the right half of the space between the right lower pulmonary vein and the left lower pulmonary vein were performed.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old female presented with a chief complaint for evaluation of an incidental finding of peripancreatic lymph node.
She underwent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis as part of her routine surveillance for extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT-lymphoma) of the lung and was found to have peripancreatic lymph node. She denied any abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, weight loss, nausea, or vomiting.
Her medical history was significant for MALT-lymphoma, invasive lobular breast carcinoma, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, mitral valve prolapse, mitral valve stenosis, and actinic keratosis. Her surgical history included a mastectomy with sentinel lymph node dissection, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy, left knee replacement, and bilateral carpal tunnel repair.
Her family history was significant for colon cancer in maternal grandmother at the age of 65 years, prostate cancer in brother at the age of 63 years, and melanoma in mother. She had no history of alcohol or tobacco abuse. She has 2 children and attained menopause at the age of 52 years. Her medications included aspirin, furosemide, carvedilol, rosuvastatin, amiodarone, digoxin, anastrozole, and Eliquis.
Her physical examination was unremarkable, and her abdomen was soft nontender, nondistended with no palpable mass.
Laboratory exam including fractionated metanephrines, chromogranin, and gastrin were negative.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed 2 cm × 1.1 cm lymph node adjacent to the pancreatic head (Figure ).
EUS showed a 19 mm × 11.5 mm hypoechoic lesion near the pancreatic head (Figure ). Two FNA passes using a 25-gauge needle were performed via transduodenal approach (Figure ).
Direct FNA smears showed tumor with neuroendocrine features. Initial immunoperoxidase stains performed on cell block sections were positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin, which seemed to confirm the morphologic impression of PNET. The pathologist was subsequently informed about the peripancreatic location and lack of a definite pancreatic lesion.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient was a 76-year-old man with a history of mild dysphasia. He had a prior history of cerebral infarctions (x3) at the age of 66, 74 and 75 years, with a first instance of swallowing difficulties after the third stroke. At that time, dysphasia rehabilitation was initiated within 3 days of the stroke, and he recovered the ability to eat a regular meal within 2 weeks. In January 2018, 1-year after his last stroke, he underwent surgery for spinal stenosis, followed by a 10-day period of bedrest. His physical activity level subsequently declined due to back pain, and he lost 10 kg within the 10 months after surgery. Swallowing difficulties re-emerged in September 2018, with the patient only able to tolerate soft meals. His dysphasia worsened, with an increase in sputum and development of a chronic cough.
His medical history included cerebral infarctions (x3), diabetes mellitus, spinal stenosis, and hypertension. His height was 168.8 cm, with a body weight of 56.5 kg. He had a right hemiplegia, with the following functional measures: grip strength, 25 kg; gait speed, 0.7 m/s, assessed using the 5-m walk test; and skeletal mass index, 6.6 kg/m2. His score of 5 points on the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form was indicative of malnourishment. Absence of another cerebral infarct was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Video-endoscopic swallowing assessment showed saliva pooling in the pharynx, widening of the pharyngeal space, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A). Video-fluorography revealed a decrease in the forward movement of the larynx, a widened pharyngeal space, weakened pharyngeal constriction, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A–C). Functional swallowing scores were as follows: Hyodo score, 9; Fujishima grade, 6; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 4. A probable diagnosis of sarcopenic dysphagia was made, based on the criteria defined by Mori et al. [] Clinical management included swallowing training, a high-protein diet, and nutritional guidance. The patient declined additional rehabilitation, due to his previous experience post-stroke. Therefore, we presented laryngeal suspension as a possible alternative treatment, which was performed in December 2018.
Laryngeal suspension was performed via a minimally invasive thyromadibulopexy, using two skin incisions: one (2-cm) incision at the level of the mandible and the other (3-cm) between the hyoid bone and the superior border of the thyroid cartilage (A). Identified the white line, divided aside the anterior cervical muscles, and exposed the thyroid cartilage. Also the mandible was exposed. Two holes in the mandibular and six holes in the thyroid cartilage was made by using drill. The thyroid cartilage was fixed to the mandible using No. 2 nylon. No. 2 nylon thread was passed through the Gore-tex sheet cut to the size of thyroid cartilage. And it was passed through the thyroid cartilage, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, mandible, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, and tied to the other side of the nylon. As the two holes of the middle of the thyroid cartilage, two No. 2 nylons was crossed to fix the thyroid cartilage and mandible. The larynx was suspended about one vertebral body by totally using five No. 2 nylons (B), confirmed by X-ray fluoroscopy. A 1-cm incision was performed for tracheotomy, and cuffed tracheal cannula was inserted for airway management.
Maintaining some neck flexion for a period of 1-week was conducted. Nutritional support was initiated via gastrostomy tube feeding. The cuffed tracheal cannula was changed to an uncuffed cannula on postoperative day (POD) 1. The wound was stable and there was no pain. Swallowing was initiated using jelly and cold tea, with the patient in a flat lateral position. The tracheal cannula was removed on POD 4. Video-fluorography revealed contrast agent residue in the vallecular but with a decrease in residue in the pyriform sinus compared to pre-operative measures, with no evidence of aspiration on POD 6 (A–C). Anterosuperior movement of the larynx was improved, reaching one vertebral level higher than before surgery. The swallowing reflex was maintained, with sufficient opening of the esophageal orifice, avoiding the need for mandibular protrusion to swallow. Swallowing using modified food was initiated in a sitting position on POD 6 and the gastrostomy tube was removed on POD 7. Video-endoscopic examination confirmed his ability to eat a rice cracker and noodles without aspiration and no evidence of pharyngeal residue on POD 11 (B). The patient was able to eat soft meals on POD 14, and a regular meal on POD 18, and was discharged on POD 21. The patient gained 2 kg in the 2 months after surgery, with improvement in functional scores: Hyodo score, 5; Fujishima grade, 8; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 6. There was no exacerbation of the condition over a 10-month period after surgery, and the patient has a normal diet and is able to travel. Neck movement restriction was not severe.

He had a prior history of cerebral infarctions (x3) at the age of 66, 74 and 75 years, with a first instance of swallowing difficulties after the third stroke. At that time, dysphasia rehabilitation was initiated within 3 days of the stroke, and he recovered the ability to eat a regular meal within 2 weeks. In January 2018, 1-year after his last stroke, he underwent surgery for spinal stenosis, followed by a 10-day period of bedrest. His physical activity level subsequently declined due to back pain, and he lost 10 kg within the 10 months after surgery. Swallowing difficulties re-emerged in September 2018, with the patient only able to tolerate soft meals. His dysphasia worsened, with an increase in sputum and development of a chronic cough. His medical history included cerebral infarctions (x3), diabetes mellitus, spinal stenosis, and hypertension. His height was 168.8 cm, with a body weight of 56.5 kg. He had a right hemiplegia, with the following functional measures: grip strength, 25 kg; gait speed, 0.7 m/s, assessed using the 5-m walk test; and skeletal mass index, 6.6 kg/m2. His score of 5 points on the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form was indicative of malnourishment. Absence of another cerebral infarct was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Video-endoscopic swallowing assessment showed saliva pooling in the pharynx, widening of the pharyngeal space, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A). Video-fluorography revealed a decrease in the forward movement of the larynx, a widened pharyngeal space, weakened pharyngeal constriction, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A–C). Functional swallowing scores were as follows: Hyodo score, 9; Fujishima grade, 6; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 4. A probable diagnosis of sarcopenic dysphagia was made, based on the criteria defined by Mori et al. [] Clinical management included swallowing training, a high-protein diet, and nutritional guidance. The patient declined additional rehabilitation, due to his previous experience post-stroke. Therefore, we presented laryngeal suspension as a possible alternative treatment, which was performed in December 2018. Laryngeal suspension was performed via a minimally invasive thyromadibulopexy, using two skin incisions: one (2-cm) incision at the level of the mandible and the other (3-cm) between the hyoid bone and the superior border of the thyroid cartilage (A). Identified the white line, divided aside the anterior cervical muscles, and exposed the thyroid cartilage. Also the mandible was exposed. Two holes in the mandibular and six holes in the thyroid cartilage was made by using drill. The thyroid cartilage was fixed to the mandible using No. 2 nylon. No. 2 nylon thread was passed through the Gore-tex sheet cut to the size of thyroid cartilage. And it was passed through the thyroid cartilage, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, mandible, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, and tied to the other side of the nylon.

 Here is the patient note:
An obese 42-year-old African American male with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, coronary arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation presented with new onset right-sided chest pain and a palpable right chest mass. Ultrasound showed an anterior right chest, well-demarcated 7.5 × 6.5 × 4.8 cm, intramuscular mass, 0.6 cm deep to the skin. CT demonstrated a 9x9x9cm necrotic mass arising from the pectoralis major. CT-guided core biopsy was positive for high-grade spindle cell neoplasm (positive for smooth muscle actin, desmin, S100, and CD31; negative for CD34, PAX8, and beta-catenin) and verified by two independent pathologists.
Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow up after referral to Oncology and Thoracic Surgery. He presented to oncology clinic with progressive symptoms including a rapidly enlarging chest mass, increasing pain, and new onset chest wall numbness. A repeat CT showed that the mass increased in size to 21.4 × 17.8 × 13.7 cm without evidence of metastatic disease over course of two months. MRI was consistent with 23 cm mass within the right pectoralis major without vascular or bony invasion. The patient chose to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy given his multiple comorbidities. He was hesitant to pursue resection and elected to attempt to shrink the tumor before resection.
Patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and docetaxel for 2 cycles followed by radiation therapy (50Gy over 2 months to tumor bed + 3 cm margins). Restaging CT showed a stable tumor at 23 cm without any evidence of local or distant metastases.
The patient returned to Thoracic surgery clinic to discuss options for resection and reconstruction. He then underwent wide local surgical resection for definitive therapy. Tumor was removed en bloc with resection to the intercostal fascia including pectoralis major and minor (Fig. ). There did not appear to be any violation of the intercostal investing fascia and no entry into the thoracic cavity was made. Negative pressure dressing was used until post-operative day 7 when Plastic Surgery performed advancement flap coverage and skin grafting to the > 1,000cm2 defect (Fig. a, b).
Final pathology demonstrated 38x20x18 cm tumor with 70% gross necrosis and R0 resection. Microscopic examination confirmed high-grade sarcoma with smooth muscle differentiation (Fig. ). Final pathologic staging based on AJCC 7th edition was Stage III G3 pT2bNxMx.

Restaging CT showed a stable tumor at 23 cm without any evidence of local or distant metastases.\nThe patient returned to Thoracic surgery clinic to discuss options for resection and reconstruction. He then underwent wide local surgical resection for definitive therapy. Tumor was removed en bloc with resection to the intercostal fascia including pectoralis major and minor (Fig. ). There did not appear to be any violation of the intercostal investing fascia and no entry into the thoracic cavity was made. Negative pressure dressing was used until post-operative day 7 when Plastic Surgery performed advancement flap coverage and skin grafting to the > 1,000cm2 defect (Fig. a, b).\nFinal pathology demonstrated 38x20x18 cm tumor with 70% gross necrosis and R0 resection.

The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is a significant risk factor. We also need to consider the patient's age, which is 42 years old. The patient has hypertension, which is another risk factor. The patient also has heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, which is a moderate risk factor. The patient does not have a history of vascular disease, diabetes, or prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. Therefore, we can calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score as follows: 2 points for atrial fibrillation, 1 point for age 40-49, 1 point for hypertension, and 1 point for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. This gives a total score of 5.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '4', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.\nThe patient is 42.0 years old.

Because the patient has congestive heart failure, one point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.\nOne criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism.

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes developed acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia (NIHSS score on admission: 4). He arrived at our hospital 45 min later. On admission, his blood pressure was 160/70 mm Hg; atrial fibrillation was detected on electrocardiography. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) revealed no early signs of cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient was unable to self-report his drug history due to persisting aphasia. The INR measured by a commercial POC device was within normal range (1.00; normal 0.85-1.18). IVT (rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg) was initiated 80 min after symptom onset and before all laboratory findings were received. Around 20 min after IVT had commenced, coagulation parameters were normal [including INR (1.10), thrombin time (18.8 s; normal 14-21), partial thromboplastin time (34.8 s, normal 23-36) and platelet counts]. A follow-up cCT ruled out IVT-induced ICH and the patient fully recovered within 48 h (NIHS score: 0). At this stage, he was able to report regular intake of apixaban (Eliquis®, 2.5 mg t.i.d.) since April 2014 due to atrial fibrillation. The last apixaban tablet had been taken 13.5 h before IVT.

 Here is the patient note:
A 46 year old male, a known hypertensive on treatment for the past 10 years, was diagnosed to have chronic renal failure 3 years ago. Consequently he progressed to ESRD and hemodialysis was initiated in December 2006 for the same, with the creation of a brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula over the left arm. He has been undergoing regular thrice weekly hemodialysis since then. He is a school teacher by occupation. He had no past history of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, or hepatic disease. No past history of Tuberculosis or TB contact. He is married and has two sons. He was a non-smoker and a non-alcoholic.
Over the past year, the artificial AV fistula enlarged in size to attain its current dimensions (Figure ). On 3rd June 2008, he presented to the emergency department of our tertiary care hospital with complaints of progressive breathlessness over the past 15 days. There was no history of associated chest pain, palpitations, syncope, cough, expectoration, or orthopnea.
On examination, he had pallor and bilateral pitting pedal edema. He was afebrile, with a pulse rate of 108/min, BP of 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28/min. A giant arteriovenous fistula was seen extending from the cubital fossa of the left arm up to the left supraclavicular region (Figure ). Respiratory system examination revealed stony dullness over the left mammary, infra-axillary and sub-scapular areas on percussion. On auscultation, there was decreased intensity of breath sounds over the above mentioned areas. Normal vesicular breath sounds were heard over all other areas. Other systems examination was unremarkable.
His blood investigations showed hemoglobin of 4.5 g/dl, BUN – 13 mg/dl, creatinine- 2.6 mg/dl, with other parameters being within normal limits. His coagulation profile was slightly deranged with a raised INR (Table ). Chest X-ray revealed a massive pleural effusion on the left side (Figure ). USG guided pleural aspiration revealed a hemorrhagic fluid. Pleural fluid analysis showed no WBCs, RBC – 5000/mm3 (normocytic 22%, crenated 88%), sugar – 70 mgs/dl, protein – 4.3 g/dl. Doppler study of the AV fistula showed a high peak velocity of 350 cms/sec, with no evidence of thrombosis or stenosis. In order to drain the hemorrhagic pleural effusion, an intercostal drain was placed. Patient was managed with 5 units packed red cell transfusion, oxygen and other supportive measures. With this presentation the possible cause for the left hemothorax was suspected to be due to the AV fistula. Hence after the patient was stabilized, the giant AV fistula was ligated on the 6th day after admission. Following ligation of the fistula, the patient's left sided pleural effusion decreased. The chest drain was removed after 7 days and patient was discharged after 3 more days. On follow up 6 weeks later, the patient did not have a recurrence of pleural effusion (Figure ). For further hemodialysis, the creation of a new fistula on his right arm has been planned.

 Here is the patient note:
We describe the case of a 70-year-old woman who developed sudden-onset vertical separation of images. This occurred only when she specifically gazed at a distance. For example, when she looked at a plant, she saw a double image that was completely vertically separated, without overlap. The bottom image was blurry and with color but of a similar size. It appeared ghostly and almost transparent. She could almost see through it; it was diaphanous. However, it did not disappear with either eye closed. The blurry second-bottom image disappeared only with the closure of both eyes or by looking away from the object. Hence, there was no evidence of palinopsia or bona fide diplopia. This phenomenon occurred for both stationary and moving objects. A moving truck was experienced as two vertically separated images, with the bottom image described as blurry. She knew that the bottom duplicated image was not real. The duplicated image was of the same size and receded as she approached it, as demonstrated by the patient's own original rendition (Figure ).
She denied any visual field loss or scotoma. The color perception was preserved. She denied photopsia, micropsia, macropsia, or metamorphopsia. Visual acuity was not diminished, and she was still able to read and write with ease. She denied a headache or weakness of the arms or legs. She saw an ophthalmologist who noted full ocular motion without any subtle ophthalmoparesis on double Maddox rod testing.
Her past medical history was significant for asthma and ulcerative colitis. Her medications included azathioprine, lansoprazole, mesalamine, and montelukast. Her mom had coronary artery disease and her dad had cerebrovascular disease. She was a non-smoker.
On examination, her blood pressure (BP) was 150/92 with a pulse of 71, which was regular. Her height is five feet with a weight of 185 pounds and a body mass index (BMI) of 36.1. The precordial examination was negative for a murmur and carotid bruits were absent in both internal carotid arteries. Her neurologic examination was non-revealing. Her gait station, cadence, and tandem walking were normal. Her cranial nerve examination was entirely normal. Specifically, the ocular motion was full without strabismus with a cover/uncover test and an alternate eye cover test. Accommodation was preserved without pupillary asymmetry, and visual field confrontation was normal. We were careful not to miss visual field neglect by sequential hemifield visual confrontation followed by simultaneous double hemifield confrontation. The rest of the cranial nerve function was normal. Visuomotor praxis was preserved with pantomime. No limb-kinetic or ideomotor apraxia was noted with coin deftness and transitive motor acts respectively. Ishihara plate color testing was normal. Power function was normal throughout and graded at 5/5 with the Medical Research Council (MRC) grading. Sensory examination was normal to graphesthesia and stereognosis in both hands. And deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and lively in the arms and legs. No dysmetria or intention tremor was noted in the arms. Heel to shin motion was normal in the legs bilaterally.
A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain shows a diffusion-weighted image (DWI) hyperintensity involving the left mesial occipital lobe; striate cortex, V1, spilling over into the adjacent visual association cortex, V2, indicating an ischemic infarct (Figure ).
There was a corresponding hypointensity on gradient echo imaging (GRE) in the region of V2 (Figure ).
A carotid duplex scan was normal. A transcranial Doppler (TCD) with a two Megahertz crystal with the insonation of temporal, transorbital, and sub-occipital windows bilaterally showed monophasic waveforms with no high-velocity jets, which was normal. Due to the embolic nature of the ischemic infarct and a normal event monitor, a cardiac loop monitor was implanted to rule out paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. A transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study did not reveal a patent foramen ovale or any evidence of cardiac vegetations or intra-cavitary thrombus. The automated Humphrey visual field test showed a subtle and patchy incongruous right homonymous hemianopia (Figure ); the patient herself did not notice any visual field deficits.
The patient was defaulted to 81 milligrams (mg) of aspirin daily.

 Here is the patient note:
A 10-year-old male patient was brought to our department with premature pubarche and onset of facial acne at the age of 8 years and increase in penis size at the age of 9 years. Concomitantly, he had a progressive, gradually worsening holocranial headache associated with drowsiness and loss of appetite. The patient denied deterioration of vision. Previously, he was a healthy patient, born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at term weighing 3510 g and measuring 50 cm. He was breastfed for 3 months and had normal neuropsychomotor development. The patient had no family history of endocrine disorders, sexual precocity, or consanguinity. The mother's and father's self-reported height was 155 cm and 175 cm respectively. Physical examination revealed height of 148 cm (90-95th percentile), weight of 39 kg (75-90th percentile), blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, heart rate of 60 beats per minute, facial acne, abdominal fat deposition in the periumbilical region, bilateral, symmetrical and prepubertal sized (3 mL) testes within the scrotum, 8-cm long penis, and Tanner stage P3-G2. Papilledema was detected on fundoscopy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a large, hyperintense tumor in the suprasellar region, with hypodense areas inside the tumor, which was located in the anterior third ventricle, measuring 3 cm in the largest diameter and causing triventricular dilatation []. Radiographs of the hands and wrists revealed significant acceleration of bone age (BA) in relation to chronological age (CA) (BA: 13 years; CA: 10 years and 8 months; standard deviation: 10 months). MRI of the abdomen yielded normal results. Laboratory tests revealed that the values for serum glucose, albumin, calcium, sodium, potassium, renal function, and liver function were within the normal limits. Hormonal tests showed increased hCG levels in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), increased total testosterone levels, and hypopituitarism (unresponsiveness to gonadorelin stimulation test) []. The results of tumor marker tests are also described in .
The patient was diagnosed with an hCG- and testosterone-producing tumor associated with hypopituitarism and intracranial hypertension. Hormone replacement therapy was initiated with levothyroxine and hydrocortisone, and transcranial surgery was performed. Anatomopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of germinoma []]. Radiotherapy was performed after surgical resection of the tumor. The patient showed complete regression of sexual characteristics and acne, with normal laboratory tests post-operatively.

 Here is the patient note:
An 82-year-old Japanese man was transferred to the emergency unit of Shimada Municipal Hospital, Shimada, Shizuoka, Japan, with complaints of severe watery diarrhea and hematochezia. The patient had suffered from hypertension and hyperlipidemia since the age of 50. He had undergone total hip replacement for right femoral head fracture caused by a traffic accident at the age of 71, and he received a surgical procedure for lumber spinal stenosis at the age of 74. Borderline diabetes mellitus with HbA1c levels ranging from 6.0% to 6.6% was pointed out since the age of 72, while the blood glucose level remained within a normal range. At the age of 76, the diagnosis of hypertensive and diabetic chronic kidney disease was made. The patient suffered from pneumonia when he was 78 years old. One year before admission, an infected cyst (abscess) around the right femoral prosthesis was indicated by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured, and the first and third-generation Cefem plus new quinolone were continuously administered. Three months before admission, continuous drainage from the infected lesion was conducted. No gastrointestinal complaints were recorded prior to the final admission.
His watery diarrhea was severe, more than 10 times a day, and hematochezia was associated. The body temperature was 37.5°C, blood pressure 138/90 mm Hg, heart rate 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 96% while breathing ambient air. The body weight was 57.0 kg with a body mass index at 22.0. Systolic heart murmur was auscultated. The abdomen was soft with weak bowel sounds. There was tenderness of the whole abdomen on palpation, without guarding, rigidity, distention, or mass formation. Main results of laboratory tests on admission included the following: white blood cells 4400/μL, hemoglobin 13.3 g/dL, platelets 305 000/μL, Na 135 mmol/L, K 3.6 mmol/L, Cl 102 mmol/L, Ca 6.4 mg/dL, Pi 4.6 mg/dL, albumin 1.8 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 49.9 mg/dL, creatinine 5.3 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 26.1 mg/dL. The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with long PR and QT intervals. Deterioration of renal functions for the last 10-year period is illustrated in Figure . For the last 3 months, hemodialysis was needed.
Plain and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, performed on the first and eighth days of hospitalization, respectively, indicated significant ischemic changes of the sigmoid colon through the rectum with wall thickening of the sigmoid colon, ascites retention, bilateral pleural effusions, and mild renal atrophy. Colonofiberscopy indicated diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and ischemic changes and erosions of the stenotic sigmoid colon through rectum (Figure ). Microbiologically, the stool proved normal flora, and fecal Clostridium difficile toxin test and blood microbial culture were negative. The clinical diagnosis of ischemic and infectious colitis secondary to the long-term usage of antibiotics was made. Intravenous infusion of ceftriaxone for 5 days was chosen empirically because it is metabolized in the liver. However, it was ineffective for relieving diarrhea and colitis, and then meropenem was chosen for controlling the intractable colonic symptoms. Inflammation peaked out 14 days after the treatment, but soon, the inflammatory reaction and diarrhea re-exacerbated. The patient expired 26 days after admission. No free air was observed in the abdominal cavity on the contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan 3 days before death.
The autopsy was conducted 6 hours after death. In the sigmoid colon, fibrosing and adhesive diverticulitis with mucosal ischemic changes and erosions were grossly observed. Microscopically, eosinophilic hyaline material was deposited throughout the gut wall. The deposits were congophilic. Immunohistochemically, amyloid A, visualized by the monoclonal antibody mc-1 against serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), was identified in the lamina propria mucosae through the subserosa, including diverticular and vascular walls (Figure ). In the prepylorus of the stomach, a large perforating ulcer measuring 12 mm was found, and purulent peritonitis with turbid ascites was associated (Figure ). Candida infection was microscopically demonstrated on the involved mucosa and serosa at the site of gastric perforation (Figure ). Candida albicans were cultured from turbid ascitic fluid containing a total of 1150 mL. Candidal esophagitis was also noted. Deposition of amyloid A was evident in the gastric mucosa through the subserosa, and the amyloid deposition was especially prominent and seen in the full-thickness of the mucosa at the site of gastric perforation (Figure ). Amyloid A was also diffusely deposited in the wall of the esophagus through the rectum. Pleural effusion was associated (left: 150 mL, right: 300 mL).
Systemic congophilic deposition of amyloid A was further demonstrated in the tongue, salivary gland, thyroid gland, lung, heart, pancreas, splenic white pulp, adrenal glands, kidney, urinary bladder, and ureter. The deposition was especially pronounced in the thyroid gland (38 g) and urinary tract.
Atrophic kidneys weighed 72 g (left) and 73 g (right). Microscopically, amyloid A deposits caused amyloid glomerulopathy in association with vascular wall involvement. Features of diabetic glomerulosclerosis were indistinct because of marked amyloid deposition, while arteriolosclerosis was observed. Pancreatic islets focally showed diabetes-related localized hyaline (amyloid) deposition. Characteristically, co-deposition of amyloid A and IgM in the renal glomerulus was demonstrated by immunostaining using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections after prolonged protease-1 digestion (Figure ). IgG and IgA were undetectable. The co-deposition of amyloid A and IgM was scarcely observed in the systemic amyloid A deposits outside the kidney (Figure ).
Most of the hepatocytes were immunostained with the anti-SAA1 monoclonal antibody mc-1. Cytoplasmic granular positivity was evident. The acinar cells of the pancreas and salivary gland were also positively stained. These findings indicated accelerated production of SAA1 protein by these cells as a prolonged inflammatory response (Figure ).
Another incidental finding included aortic stenosis caused by dystrophic calcification in the cusps of the aortic valve. Left ventricular hypertrophy (heart weight 415 g) was caused by both aortic stenosis and amyloid deposition. The aorta revealed severe atherosclerosis. The abscess lesion around the right femoral prosthesis was not evaluated.

Here is the task:
What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?

104
To calculate the patient's mean arterial pressure, we need to first calculate the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The systolic blood pressure is 138 mm Hg and the diastolic blood pressure is 90 mm Hg. Then, we can use the formula: mean arterial pressure = (systolic blood pressure + 2 x diastolic blood pressure) / 3. Plugging in the values, we get: mean arterial pressure = (138 + 2 x 90) / 3 = 104 mm Hg.

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old woman has fallen from the second story level of her home while hanging laundry. She was brought to the emergency department immediately and presented with severe abdominal pain. The patient is anxious, and her hands and feet feel very cold to the touch. There is no evidence of bone fractures, superficial skin wounds, or a foreign body penetration. Her blood pressure is 102/67 mm Hg, respirations are 19/min, pulse is 87/min, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). Her abdominal exam reveals rigidity and severe tenderness. A Foley catheter and nasogastric tube are inserted. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 cm H2O. The medical history is significant for hypertension.

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old female patient with a known case of diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease due to hypertension was started on hemodialysis in March 2014. Permanent tunneled catheters were placed into the right internal jugular vein as the patient was not fit for AVF creation due to vascular occlusions.
On 7 April 2019, at the end of a dialysis session, the patient developed fever (39°C) and chills. Fever was documented at 39°C, was associated with chills and rigors, and was not responding to antipyretics. In the emergency department, the patient reported no change in weight, loss of appetite, or night sweats. She denied any history of respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological symptoms. On examination, the temperature was 39°C, the blood pressure 150/75 mm Hg, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The patient was fully conscious and oriented. The remainder of the general medical examination was normal.
She was admitted to our nephrology unit with possible source catheter-related blood stream infection. She was started on ceftazidime 2 gm IV once daily and vancomycin 1 gm IV Q HD as per the protocol. The white blood cell count was 13.3 × 103 cells, C-reactive protein was 278 mg/dl, and procalcitonin was 52.27. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, and chest radiography was negative.
Blood culture from venous and central catheters was sampled separately, and the causative microorganism was identified as a Gram-negative, motile, lactose-fermenting bacillus, which was identified by the Vitek MS automatic identification system using a GN card as Leclercia adecarboxylata. Antibiotic sensitivity testing using Vitek 2 showed that it is an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer. The results are summarized in (). The L. adecarboxylata strain was resistant to most beta-lactams, including narrow, expanded, and broad-spectrum cephalosporins. But it was susceptible to all quinolones and carbapenems tested.
The treatment regimen was changed to meropenem 500 mg IV once daily and gentamicin based on antibiotic susceptibility tests (ASTs) from blood cultures. This targeted therapy was successful, and the patient became afebrile. The patient received meropenem and gentamicin for two weeks, and then she was discharged in good condition.

 Here is the patient note:
A 59-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with a carrot in the rectum and mild lower abdominal discomfort. He had no specific history and denied homosexual identity. The patient's blood pressure was 132/78 mm Hg; pulse rate, 88/min; respiration rate, 18/min; and body temperature, 36.5℃. Abdominal examination revealed a soft and flat abdomen with normal bowel sounds. Digital rectal examination revealed the hard bottom of the carrot near the rectal angle and normal anal sphincter tone. His laboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin level, 14.7 g/dL; white blood cell count, 17,270/mm3; and CRP level, 6.55 mg/L. The results of evaluations for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and HIV antibody were all negative. The foreign body was not observed on abdominal radiography, and no evidence of peritoneal or perirectal free air was observed ().
The carrot observed during endoscopy was deemed to be too large and heavy for removal using endoscopic devices. Hence, we decided to use tenaculum forceps from the start. By using the same techniques described previously, we were able to remove the carrot successfully (). The patient's abdominal discomfort subsided immediately, and he was discharged from the hospital.

 Here is the patient note:
A 34-year-old Surinamese female was referred to the Department of Vascular Medicine of our hospital because of right-sided blurred vision, caused by ischemic retinopathy and neovascularisation (Fig. ). Her medical history was remarkable for heterozygote alpha-thalassemia, but negative for thrombotic and recurrent infectious events. The family history was also negative for thrombotic events or bleeding tendency. The patient was not treated with anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors. Physical examination was normal (BMI 23.0 kg/m2, blood pressure 125/70 mmHg, heart rate 85/min, normal heart sounds, and no vascular murmurs). After the exclusion of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, hyperviscosity, and sickle cell disease, a thrombophilia workup was performed. All hemostatic laboratory parameters were found normal except for an increased protein S activity (179%) with high free protein S level (207%), despite a normal total protein S antigen level (98%) (Table ). This suggested that, in contrast to normal conditions, all protein S was free protein S, instead of 30–40% free and 60–70% bound protein S. High activity and antigen levels of free protein S were confirmed in a separate sample 3 months later. Clinically, a protein S deficiency is considered as a possible cause of hypercoagulation, which in turn could have led to the retinopathy. The incidental finding of elevated protein S levels were not considered explanatory of the condition. We did not initiate anticoagulation or thrombocyte aggregation inhibition. The patient's vision did not improve remarkably, nor did it deteriorate in the subsequent months after her initial visit.
The high free protein S level in the proband was caused by a reduced level of C4BP (18%), as measured with an ELISA against the α-chain of C4BP. To identify a possible molecular defect underlying the C4BP deficiency, we sequenced the protein-coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of C4BPA (encoding C4BPα, ) and C4BPB (encoding C4BPβ, ).
We identified two previously reported non-synonymous variants in C4BPA, that is, c.719G>A (p.R240H), rs45574833 ((A=0.0140/1686 (ExAC), A = 0.0030/15 (1000 Genomes), A = 0.0095/124 (GO-ESP), A = 0.0078/227 (TOPMED)), and c.899T>C (p.I300T), rs4844573 (C = 0.4014/47780 [ExAC], C = 0.4898/2453 [1000 Genomes], C = 0.4841/6296 [GO-ESP], T = 0.4689/13653 [TOPMED]).
In addition, we screened the father and brother for these mutations. Both are also Surinamese. Only p.I300T was present in the father (Fig. ). Both father and brother had normal free protein S levels. Mother, second sister, and second brother were unavailable for testing.
Discordant data concerning the association between C4BP polymorphisms and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported , . Furthermore, these two variants have also been identified in women experiencing recurrent miscarriages, but due to equally high frequencies between patients and controls, the importance of these variants in this particular clinical situation may be questionable . No mutations were found in the C4BPB gene.
Because we could not find clear molecular defect in the C4BP gene responsible for the reduced expression, and a recent report indicated that binding of protein S to C4BP promotes cellular secretion of C4BP , we also sequenced the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-like region of protein S (), responsible for binding to C4BP using the previously published primers , . No mutations explaining a reduced binding of protein S to C4BP were found in the SHBG-domain of protein S.
Although the medical records did not report any use of vitamin K antagonist, we excluded the interference of any form of vitamin K antagonists by the measurement of coagulation factors II, VII, and X which were all normal, except for factor X which was slightly increased (163%) (Table ). Furthermore, there was no indication of reduced capacity of liver synthesis with normal antithrombin and factor V levels. Furthermore, we also did not find a clear effect of decreased C4BP levels on the complement route, with normal complement pathway activities (Table ).

The patient note does not mention the patient's mean arterial pressure directly. However, it does mention the patient's blood pressure as 125/70 mmHg. To calculate the mean arterial pressure, we need to use the formula: mean arterial pressure = (systolic blood pressure + 2*diastolic blood pressure) / 3. Plugging in the values, we get: mean arterial pressure = (125 + 2*70) / 3 = 95 mmHg.
{'Row Number': 72, 'Calculator Name': 'Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)', 'Calculator ID': '5', 'Category': 'physical', 'Note ID': 'pmc-5930216-1', 'Patient Note': "A 34-year-old Surinamese female was referred to the Department of Vascular Medicine of our hospital because of right-sided blurred vision, caused by ischemic retinopathy and neovascularisation (Fig. ). Her medical history was remarkable for heterozygote alpha-thalassemia, but negative for thrombotic and recurrent infectious events. The family history was also negative for thrombotic events or bleeding tendency. The patient was not treated with anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors. Physical examination was normal (BMI 23.0 kg/m2, blood pressure 125/70 mmHg, heart rate 85/min, normal heart sounds, and no vascular murmurs). After the exclusion of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, hyperviscosity, and sickle cell disease, a thrombophilia workup was performed. All hemostatic laboratory parameters were found normal except for an increased protein S activity (179%) with high free protein S level (207%), despite a normal total protein S antigen level (98%) (Table ). This suggested that, in contrast to normal conditions, all protein S was free protein S, instead of 30–40% free and 60–70% bound protein S. High activity and antigen levels of free protein S were confirmed in a separate sample 3 months later. Clinically, a protein S deficiency is considered as a possible cause of hypercoagulation, which in turn could have led to the retinopathy. The incidental finding of elevated protein S levels were not considered explanatory of the condition. We did not initiate anticoagulation or thrombocyte aggregation inhibition. The patient's vision did not improve remarkably, nor did it deteriorate in the subsequent months after her initial visit.\nThe high free protein S level in the proband was caused by a reduced level of C4BP (18%), as measured with an ELISA against the α-chain of C4BP. To identify a possible molecular defect underlying the C4BP deficiency, we sequenced the protein-coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of C4BPA (encoding C4BPα, ) and C4BPB (encoding C4BPβ, ).\nWe identified two previously reported non-synonymous variants in C4BPA, that is, c.719G>A (p.R240H), rs45574833 ((A=0.0140/1686 (ExAC), A = 0.0030/15 (1000 Genomes), A = 0.0095/124 (GO-ESP), A = 0.0078/227 (TOPMED)), and c.899T>C (p.I300T), rs4844573 (C = 0.4014/47780 [ExAC], C = 0.4898/2453 [1000 Genomes], C = 0.4841/6296 [GO-ESP], T = 0.4689/13653 [TOPMED]).\nIn addition, we screened the father and brother for these mutations. Both are also Surinamese. Only p.I300T was present in the father (Fig. ). Both father and brother had normal free protein S levels. Mother, second sister, and second brother were unavailable for testing.\nDiscordant data concerning the association between C4BP polymorphisms and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported , . Furthermore, these two variants have also been identified in women experiencing recurrent miscarriages, but due to equally high frequencies between patients and controls, the importance of these variants in this particular clinical situation may be questionable .

 Here is the patient note:
A 21-year-old man presented to our emergency room with a complaint of right lower abdominal pain for 2 days. On physical examination, the vital signs were as follows: temperature, 37.3°C; heart rate, 94/min; respiratory rate, 20/min; blood pressure, 120/75 mm Hg. The abdominal examination was significant for tenderness and pain in the right lower quadrant upon palpation. There was no rebound tenderness or muscle rigidity. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed the following: white blood cell count, 9.54 × 109/L; neutrophilic granulocytes, 81.1%; hemoglobin, 136 g/L; platelet count, 232 × 109/L. Kidney function and other biochemical measures were normal. Computed tomography (CT, Figure A and B) showed pneumatosis in the appendix and fluid in the pelvic cavity. Based on the above findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made and a laparoscopic appendectomy was undertaken; however, the appendix was normal in appearance and an appendectomy was not performed. Intraoperatively, the terminal ileum was noted to be approximately 15 cm in diameter, hyperemic, and edematous (Figure ); there was no apparent inflammation of the appendix. Thus, terminal ileitis was diagnosed. Three days postoperatively, the patient had rose-colored petechiae and palpable purpura on the lower extremities, and HSP was diagnosed. Subsequently, methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/d iv) was administered for 5 days. Seven days postoperatively, the abdominal pain and purpura resolved. There were no recurrences in the subsequent 8 months, and long-term follow-up in the clinic was recommended.

 Here is the patient note:
A 72-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with dyspnea and myalgia that developed 2 weeks after undergoing acupuncture therapy on both knees due to arthralgia. Vital signs on admission showed hypotension (80/40 mm Hg), tachycardia (118 beats per minute), tachypnea (20 per minute), and hypothermia (35℃). On physical examination, the patient had multiple needle scars on both knees with dappled rashes on her entire body (). Her laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell counts (10100/mm3), with neutrophil 88%, elevated high sensitive C-reactive protein level of 36 mg/dL (reference range, 0-0.5 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 71/4.5 mg/dL, myoglobin 5169 ng/mL (reference range, 16.3-96.5 ng/dL), creatine kinase myocardial band 9.7 U/L (reference range, 0-3.6 U/L), Troponin I 0.28 ng/mL (re-ference range, 0-0.1 ng/mL). A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and an electrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with fluid collection in the posterolateral wall of the pericardium with no evidence of valvular vegetation or tamponade physiology (). Pericardial aspiration of the fluid revealed a bloody material () and cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. Blood cultures showed staphylococcal bacteremia (). Lab analysis of aspiration fluid showed elevated white blood cell counts >50000/mm3), with polymorph-onuclear neutrophil 90%, pH 7.3, glucose 5 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 12397 U/L, albumin 2.4 g/dL and total protein 6.2 g/dL. Percutaneous drainage and empiric antibiotic treatment were started immediately. However, the patient expired due to refractory sepsis and organ failure.

 Here is the patient note:
A 12-year-old girl, the youngest of three siblings, born of a nonconsanguineous marriage, and who had a normal perinatal history, was referred for evaluation of an incidentally detected cardiac murmur. There was failure to thrive but otherwise the patient was asymptomatic. There was no history of chest pain, syncope or palpitations. There was no family history of cardiac disease or genetic syndromes. The child had normal motor and mental development with normal intelligence. She had not attained menarche and her physical examination revealed short stature, craniofacial disproportion, shrunken facies, alopecia, prominent scalp veins, prominent eyes, micrognathia, a “beaked” nose, prominent and stiff joints, dystrophic nails, thin wrinkled skin and absent secondary sexual characteristics suggestive of a premature ageing syndrome [Figures and ]. The above-mentioned abnormal features were noted to appear after infancy.
The blood pressure was 128/92 mmHg, and all pulses were palpable, but feeble. There was bilateral carotid shudder. There was no brachiofemoral delay and clinical findings suggestive of severe aortic stenosis were present. Electrocardiography revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a strain pattern. Echocardiography showed calcified aortic cusps with severe aortic stenosis (peak systolic gradient of 72 mmHg, mean gradient of 52 mmHg), mild aortic regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation []. There was concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal function (ejection fraction 57%). The aortic valve area was estimated to be 0.7 cm2. The patient's lipid profile revealed hypercholesterolemia with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and normal high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. It was decided to manage the patient conservatively as the outcome of aortic valve balloon dilatation/surgical replacement in this condition is not well documented and also because of the extremely fragile general condition of the patient.

 Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.
Her laboratory studies were as shown in .
Serum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.
The patient was started on intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) daily for one week, then weekly for one month. She was later lost to followup, and posttreatment evaluation of the skin hyperpigmentation and neurological evaluation could not be done.

 Here is the patient note:
A 48-year-old morbidly obese African-American male with a medical history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea on 2 l of home oxygen and non-complaint with continuous positive airway pressure at night presented to the emergency department (ED) with worsening shortness of breath and lower extremity oedema over one week. Vital signs in the ED were temperature, 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 116/66 mmHg; heart rate, 130 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 30; oxygen saturation, 85% on 2 l nasal cannula; weight, 162 kg and body mass index, 47. Physical examination revealed a morbidly obese male in acute respiratory distress with an irregularly irregular pulse and one plus lower extremity pitting oedema. Laboratory values in the ED include white blood cell count, 9 800/μl; haemoglobin, 14.2 g/dl; platelet count, 230 000/μl; sodium, 140 mEq/l; potassium, 4.5 mEq/l; chloride, 104 mEq/l; bicarbonate, 29 mEq/l; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 38 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.4 mg/dl; glucose, 105 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 51 U/l; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 40 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 68 U/l; total bilirubin, 1.5 mg/dl; albumin, 3.4 g/dl; total protein, 7.1 g/dl; international normalised ratio (INR), 1.2; myoglobin, 97 μg/l; troponin, 0.07 ng/ml and B-type natriuretic peptide, 934 pg/ml. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Arterial blood gas showed a pH 7.33, paCO2 68.5 and paO2 88.6 on FiO2 of 40%. Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Echocardiogram revealed a myopathic severely enlarged left ventricular chamber with moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 8 to 10%. The patient's work of breathing and oxygenation improved with Bipap. He was started on diltiazem and diuresis was initiated. The patient was admitted to the step-down unit with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.
On hospital day number eight, the overnight nurse found the patient unresponsive. A code blue was called. His initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation and he was shocked with 200 J twice before regaining pulses. When stabilised, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he regained consciousness and full neurologic function within one hour of the event. The following day, an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was placed. Intraoperatively, the patient had runs of ventricular tachycardia with hypotension to 80 mmHg systolic. Postoperatively, the patient was found to have a right fixed mid-dilated pupil, flaccid paralysis of the left arm and leg with hyperreflexia throughout the left side. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed a right midbrain and thalamic stroke thought to be secondary to transient arrhythmia-induced hypoperfusion, intraoperatively.
On postoperative day number three, after AICD placement and stroke, the patient acutely developed a rigid distended board-like abdomen with dullness to percussion. Vitals at that time were temperature, 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 112/67 mmHg; heart rate range, 55 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 26 on ventilator settings of assist control volume control with a rate of 26; tidal volume, 500 ml; FiO2, 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5. His peak inspiratory pressure on the ventilator had risen from 26 to 72 mmHg; his plateau had risen from 15 to 48 mmHg with oxygen desaturation from 93 to 85%. The patient had received 1.5 l in and urinated 4.5 l over the 24 hours, leading up to this event. His laboratory values from that morning were unchanged from previous (white blood count, 10 400/μl; haemoglobin, 12.6 g/dl; platelets, 200 000/μl; sodium, 139 mEq/l; potassium, 4.7 mEq/l; chloride, 100 mEq/l; bicarbonate, 34 mEq/l; BUN, 36 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.41 mg/dl; glucose, 78 mg/dl; calcium, 8.3 mg/dl; magnesium, 2.0 mEq/l; phosphorus, 3.0 mg/dl; AST, 77 U/l; ALT, 94 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 186 U/l; total bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dl). This constellation of findings prompted the team to measure an abdominal compartment pressure which was elevated to 53 cm H2O (40 mmHg) with an abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) of 42 mmHg. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed no dilated loops of bowel, no ileus, no evidence of free air, abscess or obstruction and minimal free fluid []. Pertinent labs from the event revealed a lactate of 1.0 mg/dl; lipase, 159 U/l; amylase, 76 U/l; creatinine, 1.53 mg/dl. Surgery was consulted and the FiO2 was increased to 100%, which improved his oxygen saturation to 96% despite his elevated peak inspiratory pressures.
Surgical recommendations were for an emergent bedside surgical abdominal decompression. The patient was administered 10 mg of intravenous cisatracurium besylate by anaesthesia in preparation for surgical management. Shortly following paralytic administration, his peak inspiratory pressure corrected from 72 to 23 mmHg, his plateau pressure from 48 to 16 mmHg and his oxygenation status tolerated a decrease in FiO2 down to 40% with his oxygen saturation returning to baseline. Measurement of his abdominal compartment pressure revealed a drop from 53 (40 mmHg) to 23 cm H2O (17 mmHg) and then normalised to 15 cm H20 (11 mmHg) over a three-hour period. During this entire event, the patient averaged 100 to 200 cc/hr of urine output and laboratory values from the following day showed a drop in creatinine from 1.53 to 1.29 mg/dl. Given this correction, surgical management was postponed and the patient was monitored. The patient remained hospitalised for an additional 73 days. He was ultimately transferred to a skilled nursing facility without return of symptoms.

Here is the task:
What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?

To calculate the patient's mean arterial pressure, we need to find the patient's blood pressure values. From the patient note, we can find the blood pressure values as 116/66 mmHg. To calculate the mean arterial pressure, we need to calculate the diastolic pressure and then add half of the pulse pressure to it. The pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures, which is 116 - 66 = 50 mmHg. Half of the pulse pressure is 50/2 = 25 mmHg. The diastolic pressure is 66 mmHg. Therefore, the mean arterial pressure is 66 + 25 = 91 mmHg.

 Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old man presented with typical chest pain and ST-elevation inferior MI. He was a smoker with diabetes and chronic kidney disease Class 3a with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 48 mL/min/m2. The hospital had no coronary intervention facilities, so he received thrombolytic therapy. Two weeks later, he presented to our emergency department with typical chest pain and exertional dyspnoea (New York Heart Association Class III). He was on dual antiplatelet therapy, Bisoprolol, Atorvastatin, and Isosorbide dinitrates. There was no echocardiogram report with the patient.
Auscultation confirmed a harsh pansystolic murmur V/VI on his left parasternal area and across the precordium. He had bilateral, fine basal crepitations. His heart rate was 88 b.p.m. and blood pressure was 115/67 mmHg.
Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) demonstrated an akinetic inferior wall and inferior septum with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. A large, true aneurysm in the mid-cavity inferior wall was identified by its wide neck and contracting muscle layer ( and ). The inferior septum was ruptured and dissected with a large, left-to-right shunt ( and ). A TOE X-plane transgastric short-axis view in diastole showed an inferior wall aneurysm with a wide neck of 2 cm (). The aneurysm cavity connected to the RV through the ruptured part of the inferior septum, creating an LV-to-RV-to-aneurysm communication ( and ). We noted mild tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 75 mmHg. RV function was mildly reduced (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of 1.6 cm). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed non-viable inferior segments, and a 4.2 cm × 4.3 cm × 5.8 cm cavitary lesion. The LV showed a mid-inferior and inferoseptal wide-neck true aneurysm () with a focal area of ventricular septal rupture in the inferior aspect of the aneurysm with a turbulent high-velocity flow across it (). The patient’s coronary angiography displayed tight proximal and middle right coronary artery lesions, as well as a severe ostial left main, a severe mid-left anterior descending artery lesion, and severe ramus intermedius disease.
The patient was considered high surgical risk because of his age, general condition, renal impairment, and difficult anatomy of the post-infarct VSD and aneurysm. Transcatheter closure of the post-infarct VSD and inferior wall aneurysm was performed. Because of the two different pathologies, we closed the VSD first using an antegrade approach from the venous side. Next, we closed the neck of the aneurysm using a retrograde approach from the arterial side. A Terumo guidewire (260 cm) was introduced from the right common femoral vein. The wire passed from the RV to the inferior wall aneurysm to the LV and finally to the aorta. We then exchanged the Terumo guidewire with an Amplatzer stiff guidewire (260 cm).
We used an 8 French Amplatzer delivery sheath to deploy an 18-mm ASO (AGA Medical Corporation, USA) to close the VSD completely (, and ). We selected the size based on TOE measurements. The RV-to-aneurysm communication measured 14 mm, so we oversized the ASO device by 4 mm to fit inside the defect. The aneurysm was engaged in retrograde from the LV using a 6 French PG catheter introduced from the right common femoral artery and over the Terumo guidewire (260 cm), which was then replaced by a Confida stiff guidewire (Medtronic) of the same length. We cannulated the inferior aneurysm mouth with a Torque-Vue 10 F/45 delivery sheath. The ASO (26 mm) device was deployed with a large disc in the aneurysm (, and ). We selected the size based on the TOE measurement. The aneurysm mouth measured 20 mm, so we increased the ASO length by 6 mm to fit inside the aneurysm. We assured enough distance between the aneurysm mouth and the mitral valve so that the deployed disc would not affect the mitral valve. Both devices were established with the aneurysm device resting on the post-infarct VSD device ( and ).
Left ventricular (LV) injection and TOE showed complete occlusion of the post-infarct VSD and aneurysm. Both devices established contact and showed the angulated relation of their two different planes (, and ). The akinetic inferior wal procedure and fluoroscopy times were 60 min and 25 min, respectively, and the total contrast amount was 40 mL. The patient recovered uneventfully within 6 days in the intensive care unit. As EF was 45%, we selected to do full revascularization. The patient underwent complete revascularization for his right coronary artery, left main artery, proximal left anterior descending artery, and ramus intermedius (). The patient was discharged after 14 days. At his 3-month follow-up, he remained well with reasonable exercise tolerance, NYHA Class I. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no flow across the devices, no residual shunt, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%, akinetic inferior wall, and inferior septum (, and ). The systolic pulmonary artery pressure improved to 35 mmHg (). His renal function remained stable at follow-up with GFR 46 mL/min/m2.

The patient's blood pressure is mentioned as 115/67 mmHg in the patient note. To calculate the mean arterial pressure, we need to calculate the diastolic pressure and then add half of the pulse pressure to it. The pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures, which is 115 - 67 = 48 mmHg. Half of the pulse pressure is 48/2 = 24 mmHg. The diastolic pressure is 67 mmHg. Therefore, the mean arterial pressure is 67 + 24 = 91 mmHg.

 Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old woman presented at our outpatient clinic with symptomatic OA of the right knee. At admission her height was measured to be 139.8 cm and her weight was measured to be 46.5 kg. Her past medical history included NF, congenital pseudarthrosis, and combined deformities of the tibia and fibula that resulted in the shortening of the right lower limb. At presentation, her examination revealed a limited active range of motion at the right knee joint (from 0 to 90°), a valgus deformity of 14° using the femoro-tibial angle measurement, severe pain, and a progressively worsening antalgic gait due to the preexisting limb shortening. These deformities, including pseudoarthrosis, are consistent with skeletal deformities previously described in patients diagnosed with NF. She was diagnosed with Grade 4 OA as per the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification based on the results of radiographic imaging and the physical examination (). Her walking distance was limited due to pain. Passive range of motion studies revealed significant hyperextension (−10°) consistent with an increased risk for dislocation. The physical exam also revealed peroneal nerve palsy and café au-lait spots across her entire body, the latter finding indicative of advanced NF. She had previously undergone a bone transplant at the fibula with a graft taken from the tibia approximately 50 years prior; as such, there was only a limited amount of viable bone remaining to support the successful implantation of a prosthesis. As there was not sufficient viable bone stock available to support the ready-made intramedullary stem used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA; ), our initial plan was to perform a bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (BKA). Furthermore, as part of the preoperative procedure at our hospital, we conducted a bone density test. This evaluation revealed a femoral bone density of 0.525 g/cm3, which affirmed our decision to avoid a TKA, as the quality of the available bone stock would unlikely be sufficient to support adequate fixation of the larger implants required in this procedure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed to provide maximum visualization of the lesion, given the discrepancies in the anatomical structures and also to evaluate the soft tissue condition (). Although a bicompartmental knee implant was templated, the cartilage on the medial side of the joint was found to be intact on the coronal MRI scan, thereby presenting a contraindication to this procedure (). Additional radiographic studies revealed that the patient had both femoral and tibial insufficiency and a significant reduction in the bone stock available for the positioning of an implant that required a tibial stem. As this patient also exhibited problems with osteogenesis due to NF, all procedures were planned with the goal of limiting the degree of tissue damage. With this in mind, we considered unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) as a minimally invasive procedure that might be used for the successful amelioration of her OA symptoms. A lateral UKA to fix the valgus deformity was discussed with the patient as a means to provide adequate relief from the pain resulting from the bone-on-bone contact at the lateral side as well as to address the problem of hyperextension. The patient agreed to this course of action. Preoperative planning focused on addressing the issues associated with bone-on-bone contact as well as repair of the valgus deformity with the goal of promoting stability at the knee. The range of motion was verified preoperatively, and femoral and tibial contact points were mapped across the full range of motion to determine the degree of the anterior slope. Unfortunately, the dimensions of the anterior slope precluded the use of an implant of the size that would be desirable given the patient’s tibial dimensions. We were also aware of the fact that the risks of dislocation are increased in NF patients due to characteristic joint hypermobility and problems with soft tissue in areas such as the skin, menisci, and musculature.
During surgery, the surrounding tissue was debrided, and a large fragment of debris was removed from the joint space. Visual inspection of the knee confirmed the diagnosis of isolated lateral OA with intact medial articulation (). A femoral unicompartmental knee system (Physica ZUK; size D) implant and a 29 mm × 50 mm tibial implant (Zimmer®) were inserted. Perioperative radiographs revealed that, although the trial implant was slightly larger than ideal, synchronous soft tissue balance of the knee was confirmed (). Unfortunately, as customized implants were not available, space remained between the femoral implant and the femoral condyle.
Prior to final fixation, the articulation site was copiously irrigated to facilitate the penetration of cement into the femur and tibia. The final implant was then inserted into small holes that were drilled into the tibia and femur that also facilitated cement adhesion. The cement was molded to fill the gap observed during the trial implantation ().
Postoperative imaging and physical examination revealed that the anterior tibial slope was repaired and that the valgus deformity was reduced to 5° from the 14° determined preoperatively (). The patient was capable of ambulation within 24 hours after completion of the procedure. However, the patient developed a varus thrust and continued to require epidural analgesia for 48 hours after the procedure. The rehabilitation plan included assisted range of motion and partial weight-bearing walking exercises. The patient exhibited a myopathic gait; this was deemed acceptable given her preexisting musculoskeletal condition. One week after the procedure, the patient continued to ambulate with the assistance of two walking poles and a knee brace. She reported that soreness developed after walking for approximately 20 meters; this was attributed to preoperative muscle stiffness (). The active range of motion extended from 0 to 110°; this represented a significant improvement over her preoperative range of 0 to 90°. Ankle movement was restricted due to preexisting peroneal nerve palsy and mild pain was present after the surgery. The most substantial functional gains from the lateral UKA procedure were the improvements in the knee alignment and the reduction in the valgus deformity. Both of these corrections contributed to significant improvements in patient ambulation.
Two weeks after the procedure, the patient experienced a fall that resulted in a stress fracture of the tibial plateau. The lesion was diagnosed as a proximal oblique fracture of the tibia. This was most likely due to a mismatch between the implant and patient-specific mechano-physiology which may have potentially resulted in sagittal overcutting. The tibial UKA component was not displaced (). Three days post-fracture, a surgical procedure involving a locking plate was planned. A distal tibia anterolateral plate (A.L.P.S®) with nine holes was rotated upside down to achieve successful fixation of the fracture. Eight locking cortical screws were inserted; postoperative imaging documented adequate fixation and support (). Given the high risk for dislocations, continuous passive motion therapy was contraindicated. Within five days after the second procedure, the patient reported only minimal pain and was able to undergo successful rehabilitation to improve her range of motion. We note that her participation in the standard rehabilitation program was interrupted due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was unfortunate, as adequate postoperative rehabilitation can be critical for recovery. The patient was provided with a fixed knee brace to stabilize her leg during the first two months after the insertion of the locking plate. As the COVID-19 pandemic was then under adequate control in the region, the patient was able to follow a rehabilitation plan that included both passive and active progressive range of motion exercises, partial weight-bearing walking regimens, and measures designed to manage pain and swelling. The patient was put on a partial weight-bearing walking regimen (30% to start, gradually increased to 100% body weight every week) beginning at one week postoperatively. At the two-month postoperative checkup, the patient was able to walk with a full weight load without assistance (). Four months after the procedure, the patient reported significant improvements with respect to pain and active range of motion. The patient returned to her activities of daily life and did not need a knee brace or supporter (). Radiographic images revealed callus formation at the fracture site, indicative of new bone formation. We planned to follow this patient on a more long-term basis to manage pain and swelling and to maintain the improved range of motion and weight-bearing capability. However, the overall impact of COVID-19 limited the extent to which we could follow this patient after the five-month check-up. Nonetheless, the patient planned to continue with the prescribed rehabilitation plan. The patient presented for a 7-month postoperative checkup and reported some residual pain that she managed effectively with the pain medication regimen that was prescribed. She reported that she was able to walk on most days and carry out day-to-day activities without difficulty. On certain days, she noted some instability at her knee joint which is likely attributable to the postoperative fracture. Further radiographic studies revealed appropriate fracture healing, and her physical exam documented appropriate knee alignment.
Although the patient was capable of ambulation prior to the UKA procedure, she relied on external support and experienced substantial pain due to osteoarthritis and poor knee alignment. The contraindications to a conventional TKA outweighed the possible benefits that might be achieved in this case. A UKA seemed to be a more appropriate solution toward resolving the pain resulting from bone-on-bone contact and the valgus deformity. The UKA procedure is less invasive, maintains the kinematics at the knee, preserves more bone, and facilitates easier revision surgery if this becomes necessary.
The decision to perform a UKA was controversial due to the unique complexities associated with this patient. However, these therapeutic modalities resulted in a significant improvement in the patient’s quality of life. This outcome was evaluated quantitatively by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) which is included in the (). An increase of 8–10 points on the KOOS total score has been clearly established as a clinically significant improvement. Our patient exhibited a 23.2-point increase in KOOS in response to treatment. This finding indicates that the patient experienced significant benefit from the complete treatment plan. Specifically, the patient reported improvements in areas including but not limited to, a reduction in pain, reduced stiffness, improved mobility, and a better quality of life.

To calculate the patient's BMI, we need to first calculate their body mass index (BMI) which is defined as the patient's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. The patient's weight is given as 46.5 kg and their height is given as 139.8 cm. We need to convert the height from centimeters to meters by dividing it by 100. Then, we can calculate the BMI by dividing the patient's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.
{'Row Number': 82, 'Calculator Name': 'Body Mass Index (BMI)', 'Calculator ID': '6', 'Category': 'physical', 'Note ID': 'pmc-8131347-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 76-year-old woman presented at our outpatient clinic with symptomatic OA of the right knee. At admission her height was measured to be 139.8 cm and her weight was measured to be 46.5 kg. Her past medical history included NF, congenital pseudarthrosis, and combined deformities of the tibia and fibula that resulted in the shortening of the right lower limb. At presentation, her examination revealed a limited active range of motion at the right knee joint (from 0 to 90°), a valgus deformity of 14° using the femoro-tibial angle measurement, severe pain, and a progressively worsening antalgic gait due to the preexisting limb shortening. These deformities, including pseudoarthrosis, are consistent with skeletal deformities previously described in patients diagnosed with NF. She was diagnosed with Grade 4 OA as per the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification based on the results of radiographic imaging and the physical examination (). Her walking distance was limited due to pain. Passive range of motion studies revealed significant hyperextension (−10°) consistent with an increased risk for dislocation. The physical exam also revealed peroneal nerve palsy and café au-lait spots across her entire body, the latter finding indicative of advanced NF. She had previously undergone a bone transplant at the fibula with a graft taken from the tibia approximately 50 years prior; as such, there was only a limited amount of viable bone remaining to support the successful implantation of a prosthesis. As there was not sufficient viable bone stock available to support the ready-made intramedullary stem used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA; ), our initial plan was to perform a bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (BKA). Furthermore, as part of the preoperative procedure at our hospital, we conducted a bone density test. This evaluation revealed a femoral bone density of 0.525 g/cm3, which affirmed our decision to avoid a TKA, as the quality of the available bone stock would unlikely be sufficient to support adequate fixation of the larger implants required in this procedure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed to provide maximum visualization of the lesion, given the discrepancies in the anatomical structures and also to evaluate the soft tissue condition (). Although a bicompartmental knee implant was templated, the cartilage on the medial side of the joint was found to be intact on the coronal MRI scan, thereby presenting a contraindication to this procedure (). Additional radiographic studies revealed that the patient had both femoral and tibial insufficiency and a significant reduction in the bone stock available for the positioning of an implant that required a tibial stem. As this patient also exhibited problems with osteogenesis due to NF, all procedures were planned with the goal of limiting the degree of tissue damage. With this in mind, we considered unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) as a minimally invasive procedure that might be used for the successful amelioration of her OA symptoms. A lateral UKA to fix the valgus deformity was discussed with the patient as a means to provide adequate relief from the pain resulting from the bone-on-bone contact at the lateral side as well as to address the problem of hyperextension. The patient agreed to this course of action. Preoperative planning focused on addressing the issues associated with bone-on-bone contact as well as repair of the valgus deformity with the goal of promoting stability at the knee. The range of motion was verified preoperatively, and femoral and tibial contact points were mapped across the full range of motion to determine the degree of the anterior slope. Unfortunately, the dimensions of the anterior slope precluded the use of an implant of the size that would be desirable given the patient’s tibial dimensions. We were also aware of the fact that the risks of dislocation are increased in NF patients due to characteristic joint hypermobility and problems with soft tissue in areas such as the skin, menisci, and musculature.\nDuring surgery, the surrounding tissue was debrided, and a large fragment of debris was removed from the joint space. Visual inspection of the knee confirmed the diagnosis of isolated lateral OA with intact medial articulation (). A femoral unicompartmental knee system (Physica ZUK; size D) implant and a 29 mm × 50 mm tibial implant (Zimmer®) were inserted. Perioperative radiographs revealed that, although the trial implant was slightly larger than ideal, synchronous soft tissue balance of the knee was confirmed (). Unfortunately, as customized implants were not available, space remained between the femoral implant and the femoral condyle.\nPrior to final fixation, the articulation site was copiously irrigated to facilitate the penetration of cement into the femur and tibia. The final implant was then inserted into small holes that were drilled into the tibia and femur that also facilitated cement adhesion. The cement was molded to fill the gap observed during the trial implantation ().\nPostoperative imaging and physical examination revealed that the anterior tibial slope was repaired and that the valgus deformity was reduced to 5° from the 14° determined preoperatively (). The patient was capable of ambulation within 24 hours after completion of the procedure. However, the patient developed a varus thrust and continued to require epidural analgesia for 48 hours after the procedure. The rehabilitation plan included assisted range of motion and partial weight-bearing walking exercises. The patient exhibited a myopathic gait; this was deemed acceptable given her preexisting musculoskeletal condition. One week after the procedure, the patient continued to ambulate with the assistance of two walking poles and a knee brace. She reported that soreness developed after walking for approximately 20 meters; this was attributed to preoperative muscle stiffness (). The active range of motion extended from 0 to 110°; this represented a significant improvement over her preoperative range of 0 to 90°. Ankle movement was restricted due to preexisting peroneal nerve palsy and mild pain was present after the surgery. The most substantial functional gains from the lateral UKA procedure were the improvements in the knee alignment and the reduction in the valgus deformity. Both of these corrections contributed to significant improvements in patient ambulation.\nTwo weeks after the procedure, the patient experienced a fall that resulted in a stress fracture of the tibial plateau. The lesion was diagnosed as a proximal oblique fracture of the tibia. This was most likely due to a mismatch between the implant and patient-specific mechano-physiology which may have potentially resulted in sagittal overcutting. The tibial UKA component was not displaced (). Three days post-fracture, a surgical procedure involving a locking plate was planned. A distal tibia anterolateral plate (A.L.P.S®) with nine holes was rotated upside down to achieve successful fixation of the fracture. Eight locking cortical screws were inserted; postoperative imaging documented adequate fixation and support (). Given the high risk for dislocations, continuous passive motion therapy was contraindicated. Within five days after the second procedure, the patient reported only minimal pain and was able to undergo successful rehabilitation to improve her range of motion. We note that her participation in the standard rehabilitation program was interrupted due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was unfortunate, as adequate postoperative rehabilitation can be critical for recovery. The patient was provided with a fixed knee brace to stabilize her leg during the first two months after the insertion of the locking plate. As the COVID-19 pandemic was then under adequate control in the region, the patient was able to follow a rehabilitation plan that included both passive and active progressive range of motion exercises, partial weight-bearing walking regimens, and measures designed to manage pain and swelling. The patient was put on a partial weight-bearing walking regimen (30% to start, gradually increased to 100% body weight every week) beginning at one week postoperatively. At the two-month postoperative checkup, the patient was able to walk with a full weight load without assistance (). Four months after the procedure, the patient reported significant improvements with respect to pain and active range of motion. The patient returned to her activities of daily life and did not need a knee brace or supporter (). Radiographic images revealed callus formation at the fracture site, indicative of new bone formation. We planned to follow this patient on a more long-term basis to manage pain and swelling and to maintain the improved range of motion and weight-bearing capability. However, the overall impact of COVID-19 limited the extent to which we could follow this patient after the five-month check-up. Nonetheless, the patient planned to continue with the prescribed rehabilitation plan. The patient presented for a 7-month postoperative checkup and reported some residual pain that she managed effectively with the pain medication regimen that was prescribed. She reported that she was able to walk on most days and carry out day-to-day activities without difficulty. On certain days, she noted some instability at her knee joint which is likely attributable to the postoperative fracture. Further radiographic studies revealed appropriate fracture healing, and her physical exam documented appropriate knee alignment.\nAlthough the patient was capable of ambulation prior to the UKA procedure, she relied on external support and experienced substantial pain due to osteoarthritis and poor knee alignment. The contraindications to a conventional TKA outweighed the possible benefits that might be achieved in this case. A UKA seemed to be a more appropriate solution toward resolving the pain resulting from bone-on-bone contact and the valgus deformity. The UKA procedure is less invasive, maintains the kinematics at the knee, preserves more bone, and facilitates easier revision surgery if this becomes necessary.\nThe decision to perform a UKA was controversial due to the unique complexities associated with this patient. However, these therapeutic modalities resulted in a significant improvement in the patient’s quality of life. This outcome was evaluated quantitatively by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) which is included in the (). An increase of 8–10 points on the KOOS total score has been clearly established as a clinically significant improvement. Our patient exhibited a 23.2-point increase in KOOS in response to treatment. This finding indicates that the patient experienced significant benefit from the complete treatment plan. Specifically, the patient reported improvements in areas including but not limited to, a reduction in pain, reduced stiffness, improved mobility, and a better quality of life.', 'Question': "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

 Here is the patient note:
When waking in the early morning (3:30 am), a 33-year-old male presented with persistent right limb weakness and verbal confusion. There was no record of special past history or family history. He smoked 2–5 cigarettes per day and had been drinking for 10 years. His height was 170 cm and weight 81 kg, while his blood pressure was 155/110 mmHg. The subject was alert and conscious and his speech was dysarthric with right central facial weakness. Found with extensor plantar response on right lower extremity was mild weakness of the right upper limb extensors and right lower limb flexors. Abnormal long signal of the left pontine was showed in brain MRI by FLAIR sequences (Fig. A). Conducting Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of neck and intracranial arteries revealed limited narrow on the right anterior cerebral artery A2 segment and the left anterior cerebral artery segment A3 and limited moderate stenosis on the initial segment of the right vertebral artery (Fig. B). Echocardiography on dynamic ECG, color Doppler ultrasound of the neck and echocardiography were found to be normal. Measurements of hemoglobin 170 g/L, hematocrit 46.1%, ALT 48 U/L, GOT 278 U/L, blood glucose 7.6 mmol/L, homocysteine 17.2 umol/L, triglyceride 10.5 mmol/L, LDL 3.38 mmol/L. Results of the examination of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, ENA spectrum and antithrombin III were all normal (Table ). Two emboli were detected during 9th cardiac cycle when the patient breathed quietly by c-TCD test. During the 8th cardiac cycle (rain curtain) after Valsalva action, a large number of embolus signals were revealed (Fig. C). After Valsalva action, embolism rain disappeared (Table ). TEE examination is not tolerated by patients. Sleep stage test reviewed normal sleep latency after whole night PSG examination. The lowest and average oxygen saturation was 72% and 93%, respectively. Snoring time accounted for 38.0% of sleep time. In summary, the diagnosis for the patient was “obstructive sleep apnea syndrome” (Table ).

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old male patient visited the hospital to undergo synovectomy for left knee ostarthritis and tenosynovitis. The patient had suffered difficulties in walking from weakening of both lower limb muscles since 25 years ago, and recently the symptom of weakness of lower limb muscles became more serious and dyspnea at the level of ATS (American Thoracic Society) Dyspnea Grade I had occurred due to the weakening of the respiratory root. A molecular genetics examination conducted at another hospital discovered a deficit of the SMN1 gene, and considering the time of onset and clinical conditions, the patient was diagnosed with type IV spinal muscular atrophy. The patient stood 168 cm and weighed 63 kg, and there were no special opinions from ECG and simple radioactive examination before operation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed pH 7.435, PaO2 74.6 mmHg, PaCO2 36.9 mmHg, and HCO3- 24.2 mmHg. The patient was under drug treatment for hypertension. Administration before anesthesia was not conducted and vital signs examined after going into the operating room were blood pressure: 160/100 mmHg; respiration rate per minute: 20 times; ECG: normal sinus rhythm; and pulse oxymetry: 98%. From a manual muscle test before operation, both legs were at the 4th stage. At the genupectoral position, the epidural space was identified by loss of resistance technique using an 18 G Tuohy insertion needle in between the L2-L3 lumbar, and after a test dose injection of 1.5% lidocaine 3 ml containing 1 : 200,000 epinephrine, no increase of heart rate or spinal anesthesia symptom was detected. After injecting 0.75% ropivacaine 12 ml, a catheter was placed and maintained. To measure the level of motor block by time after anesthesia, a modified Bromage scale (0: One can stretch and raise his/her leg; 1: One cannot raise his/her leg and cannot bend his/her knee; 2: One cannot his/her knee but can bend his/her ankle; 3: One cannot bend his/her ankle) was applied.
The level of modified Bromage scale before anesthesia was 1, and 20 minutes after injecting ropivacaine, the level of modified Bromage scale was 3. The sensory nerves were blocked by T8 segment on pinprick examination. Vital signs during operation were blood pressure: 120-140/60-80 mmHg and pulse rate per minute: stable at 70-80 times. A Venti® mask with 35% of oxygen fraction in inspired air was used, and an ETCO2 capnometer was placed under the nose of the patient to monitor the end-tidal CO2. ETCO2 was stable at 35 mmHg and the pulse oxymetry was 100%. Due to the risk of aspiration of saliva or bronchial secretion during operation, sedation was not operated. The surgery was operated for an hour, and the epidural catheter was removed after operation. After finishing the operation, the level of modified Bromage scale was 3 and the sensory nerve block was decreased up to the T9 segment. Three hours after the operation, the level of modified Bromage scale was dropped to 2 and the sensory nerve block to the T11 segment; 5 hours after the operation, the stage of modified Bromage scale was 1, and the sensory nerve was declined to the L1 segment. Since the patient did not show adverse effects including vomiting, nausea, and dizziness in the recovery room, he was moved to a patient room. Twelve hours after finishing the operation, both the level of the modified Bromage scale and sensory nerve were recovered to the condition before operation, and also for the manual muscle test, both legs were maintained at the 4th stage. A physical exam conducted 24 hours after finishing surgery did not show special opinions. The patient recovered smoothly without complications and left the hospital 2 days after the operation.

The patient had suffered difficulties in walking from weakening of both lower limb muscles since 25 years ago, and recently the symptom of weakness of lower limb muscles became more serious and dyspnea at the level of ATS (American Thoracic Society) Dyspnea Grade I had occurred due to the weakening of the respiratory root. A molecular genetics examination conducted at another hospital discovered a deficit of the SMN1 gene, and considering the time of onset and clinical conditions, the patient was diagnosed with type IV spinal muscular atrophy. The patient stood 168 cm and weighed 63 kg, and there were no special opinions from ECG and simple radioactive examination before operation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed pH 7.435, PaO2 74.6 mmHg, PaCO2 36.9 mmHg, and HCO3- 24.2 mmHg. The patient was under drug treatment for hypertension. Administration before anesthesia was not conducted and vital signs examined after going into the operating room were blood pressure: 160/100 mmHg; respiration rate per minute: 20 times; ECG: normal sinus rhythm; and pulse oxymetry: 98%. From a manual muscle test before operation, both legs were at the 4th stage. At the genupectoral position, the epidural space was identified by loss of resistance technique using an 18 G Tuohy insertion needle in between the L2-L3 lumbar, and after a test dose injection of 1.5% lidocaine 3 ml containing 1 : 200,000 epinephrine, no increase of heart rate or spinal anesthesia symptom was detected. After injecting 0.75% ropivacaine 12 ml, a catheter was placed and maintained.

First, we need to find the patient's height in meters. Since the patient's height is given in centimeters, we need to convert it to meters. 168 cm is equal to 1.68 m. Then, we need to find the patient's weight in kilograms. The patient's weight is given as 63 kg. Finally, we can calculate the patient's BMI by dividing their weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in m)².

 Here is the patient note:
A 48-year-old female patient (weight: 66 kg, height: 166 cm) with multiple millimetric gallstones was due to undergo intraoperative ERCP followed by LC. She had a history of caesarean section and appendectomy and had elevated transaminases plus hyperbilirubinemia. She was accepted as being American Anesthesiology Association (ASA) Class 1. ESP block was planned as part of her multimodal analgesia protocol.
After premedication (midazolam 1 mg), anesthesia induction was performed using lidocaine 1 mg/kg, fentanyl 100 mcg, propofol 3 mg/kg, and rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg. Following intubation, anesthesia was maintained with 0.6 MAC sevoflurane in air-oxygen mixture and remifentanil infusion of 0.08–0.1μg/kg/min. After hemodynamic stability, the patient was placed in the prone position. Bilateral ESP block was performed. After completing ERCP, the patient was positioned supine and LC was performed. Total surgical time was 74 minutes and time under anesthesia was 93 minutes. Perioperative intravenous paracetamol (1 gr) and tenoxicam (20 mg) were given.
She was transferred to the postoperative recovery room after extubation. The patients numeric rating scale (NRS) was 1/10 at rest and when coughing. After follow-up of 1 hour the patient was transferred to the general ward. Postoperative analgesia was ordered as 1 gr intravenous paracetamol every 8 hours. Rescue analgesia was planned as being intramuscular diclofenac sodium 75 mg. The patient's NRS was <3/10 during the first 16 hours of follow-up. Planned analgesia was not applied during this time. At 17th hour, NRS scores were 5/10 when coughing and 4/10 at rest. Rescue analgesia was performed. The patient was externalised home at the 24th hour with prescription pain medication.

 Here is the patient note:
A 4 month-old-male patient presenting weakness and decreased movement of the left lower extremity was transferred to our institute. He was born from an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. He was in good health until 1 month before the visit when his parents noticed weakness of left lower extremity. He received OPV with DTaP at local health center 1 month before presenting those symptoms. Making the diagnosis in this case was somewhat delayed because his parents hesitated to seek a proper medical help initially and took him to an orthopedics clinic where he was evaluated and treated under a misdiagnosis. His family history and past medical history of perinatal period were unremarkable.
His body weight was 8.1 kg, length 66 cm, and head circumference 41.2 cm and those growth indexes measurements continued to be in the 50-90th percentile at the time of this report (2 yr old). Vital signs were not remarkable. The physical examination revealed alert mental status, and cranial nerve function tests were all normal. Neurologic examination revealed markedly decreased spontaneous movement and flaccid paralysis on the left lower extremity (GI/V) with knee jerk (+/-), biceps tendon reflex (+/+), and ankle clonus (-/-). The response to painful stimuli on the left lower extremity was markedly reduced, but there was normal in other part of his body. He had no history of intramuscular injection or trauma on the left side buttock area. Laboratory evaluation, simple skeletal radiography, hip joint sonogram, and 3-phase bone scan were all within normal ranges. Brain and spinal MRI showed no abnormalities. Electrodiagnostic evaluations showed normal sensory nerve action potentials and low amplitudes in left tibial and deep peroneal nerve.
Up to the time of this presentation, he was able to sit alone at 10 months old and walk unaided (left side heel walking) at 16 months of age. His development quotients (by Korean developmental screening test) of gross motor, fine motor, personal-social, language, and cognitive-adaptation were all 100 in each category. Bayley scales of infant showed mildly delayed performances. His upper limb diameters (mid-arm) were 7.5/7.5 cm, diameters of lower extremities were 30.5/28 cm at the mid-thigh and 22/20 cm at the mid-calf level. At the time of presentation, he had muscle weakness (GIV/V), hypotonia, and atrophy on the left lower extremity with ipsilateral claw foot (). Other aspects of his growth and development were excellent.

18.63
To calculate the patient's body mass index (BMI), we need to know his weight and height. From the patient note, we can find his weight (8.1 kg) and height (66 cm). We need to convert the height from centimeters to meters. 66 cm is equal to 0.66 meters. Then, we can calculate the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in meters) squared. BMI = 8.1 kg / (0.66 m)². BMI = 8.1 kg / 0.4356 m². BMI = 18.63 kg/m².

He received OPV with DTaP at local health center 1 month before presenting those symptoms. Making the diagnosis in this case was somewhat delayed because his parents hesitated to seek a proper medical help initially and took him to an orthopedics clinic where he was evaluated and treated under a misdiagnosis. His family history and past medical history of perinatal period were unremarkable.\nHis body weight was 8.1 kg, length 66 cm, and head circumference 41.2 cm and those growth indexes measurements continued to be in the 50-90th percentile at the time of this report (2 yr old). Vital signs were not remarkable. The physical examination revealed alert mental status, and cranial nerve function tests were all normal. Neurologic examination revealed markedly decreased spontaneous movement and flaccid paralysis on the left lower extremity (GI/V) with knee jerk (+/-), biceps tendon reflex (+/+), and ankle clonus (-/-). The response to painful stimuli on the left lower extremity was markedly reduced, but there was normal in other part of his body. He had no history of intramuscular injection or trauma on the left side buttock area. Laboratory evaluation, simple skeletal radiography, hip joint sonogram, and 3-phase bone scan were all within normal ranges. Brain and spinal MRI showed no abnormalities. Electrodiagnostic evaluations showed normal sensory nerve action potentials and low amplitudes in left tibial and deep peroneal nerve.\nUp to the time of this presentation, he was able to sit alone at 10 months old and walk unaided (left side heel walking) at 16 months of age. His development quotients (by Korean developmental screening test) of gross motor, fine motor, personal-social, language, and cognitive-adaptation were all 100 in each category.

 Here is the patient note:
A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().
The patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.

 Here is the patient note:
The case we present was a 71-year-old Japanese man. When he was being treated for pneumonia at another hospital, CT image incidentally revealed a BT and mild right-sided hydronephrosis (Fig. ) without metastasis. After his pneumonia had been cured, the patient was referred to the SIMC to receive treatment for his BT (SIMC-Uro# 11116, a unique non-sequential patient control number issued at the Department of Uro-Oncology, SIMC). At his first visit, the patient's physical (height: 1.56 m, weight: 48.9 kg) and routine laboratory data were within the normal ranges. He had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, which required regular insulin injections. MRI showed many BTs (Figs –). The largest tumor detected on MRI is indicated by the blue arrowhead in Figure a. The tumor indicated by the yellow arrowhead was observed as it progressed between the right ureteral wall (white arrowhead in Figure a) and bladder wall (red arrowhead). Moreover, a tumor was found within the right orifice of the ureter (green arrowhead), which had presumably caused the mild right-sided hydroureter (“u” in Figure a, see also Figures –). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with bladder carcinoma, which was suspected to have infiltrated into the ureter (green arrowhead). No apparent muscle invasion, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis was observed (clinical classification: T1, N0, M0, according to the classification of the Union for International Cancer Control).
The patient underwent oral-PDD-TUR-BT (20 mg/kg of 5-ALA was administered 2 hours before surgery) using the D-LIGHT system (Table ). As suggested by MRI (blue arrowhead in Figure a), the main papillary tumor was located on the right ureteral orifice (blue arrowhead in Figure b), and it clearly emitted fluorescence under blue light (Fig. c). It had invaded the bladder neck, the prostatic urethra, and the right posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). In addition, three daughter tumors were found on the posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). Random bladder biopsy samples were obtained from the surrounding normal tissue (the posterior, left, and right walls) and the tumor-infiltrated tissue (the bladder neck and prostatic urethra). Subsequently, we deeply resected the largest tumor (Fig. b,c). The right ureteral orifice was exposed, and it was found to have been blocked by papillary tumors (the tumors in the ureter and the ureteral wall are indicated by green and white arrowheads, respectively; Fig. d,e). We deeply resected the tumors in the ureteral orifice; however, after the resection procedure residual tumors were identified within the ureteral orifice (green arrowhead in Figure f), which emitted potent fluorescence under blue light (Fig. g, see also Video ). We decided to attempt to remove the remaining tumors. After the second and third attempts to resect the ureteral tumors (deep resections, Video ), no tumors were visible under white light in the right ureter (Fig. h); however, marked fluorescence was observed from the ureteral mucosa (Fig. i), which was indicative of residual cancer. If the patient had undergone TUR without PDD, we would have finished the surgery at this point. Instead, we performed a biopsy of the fluorescence-emitting tissue. We then attempted to remove the suspected residual carcinoma. After the fourth resection of the ureteral orifice, the hydroureter-affected lumen was exposed, the mucosa of which was smooth and did not emit fluorescence (Fig. j,k). Subsequently, we performed a biopsy of the ureteral mucosa (Video ).
The pathological diagnosis of the BT was low-grade urothelial carcinoma, which had not invaded the muscular layer (pTa). No cancer cells were detected in random biopsy specimens. As expected from the PDD, low-grade cancer cells were detected in the ureteral mucosa after the third resection of the ureteral orifice, in which an irregular and fluorescent mucosa was identified (Fig. h,i). On the other hand, no cancer cells were found in the smooth and non-fluorescent mucosa after the fourth resection procedure. To prevent tumor recurrence, the patient is currently being treated with intravesically administered BCG via a right ureteral stent, which exposes both the ureter and the bladder to BCG. We concluded that the ureteral tumor was a BT that had infiltrated into the ureter because (i) preoperative MRI (Fig. a) showed that the main tumor was located in the bladder, (ii) the hydronephrosis was mild (CT findings, Figure ; the hydronephrosis would have been severe if the ureteral tumor had originated from the ureteral orifice), and (iii) the pathological analyses did not show muscular invasion. Thus, we succeeded in resecting the tumor in the ureteral orifice, which was accomplished via PDD using orally administered 5-ALA.

{'Row Number': 88, 'Calculator Name': 'Body Mass Index (BMI)', 'Calculator ID': '6', 'Category': 'physical', 'Note ID': 'pmc-7292160-1', 'Patient Note': "The case we present was a 71-year-old Japanese man. When he was being treated for pneumonia at another hospital, CT image incidentally revealed a BT and mild right-sided hydronephrosis (Fig. ) without metastasis. After his pneumonia had been cured, the patient was referred to the SIMC to receive treatment for his BT (SIMC-Uro# 11116, a unique non-sequential patient control number issued at the Department of Uro-Oncology, SIMC). At his first visit, the patient's physical (height: 1.56 m, weight: 48.9 kg) and routine laboratory data were within the normal ranges. He had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, which required regular insulin injections. MRI showed many BTs (Figs –). The largest tumor detected on MRI is indicated by the blue arrowhead in Figure a. The tumor indicated by the yellow arrowhead was observed as it progressed between the right ureteral wall (white arrowhead in Figure a) and bladder wall (red arrowhead). Moreover, a tumor was found within the right orifice of the ureter (green arrowhead), which had presumably caused the mild right-sided hydroureter (“u” in Figure a, see also Figures –). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with bladder carcinoma, which was suspected to have infiltrated into the ureter (green arrowhead). No apparent muscle invasion, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis was observed (clinical classification: T1, N0, M0, according to the classification of the Union for International Cancer Control).\nThe patient underwent oral-PDD-TUR-BT (20 mg/kg of 5-ALA was administered 2 hours before surgery) using the D-LIGHT system (Table ). As suggested by MRI (blue arrowhead in Figure a), the main papillary tumor was located on the right ureteral orifice (blue arrowhead in Figure b), and it clearly emitted fluorescence under blue light (Fig. c). It had invaded the bladder neck, the prostatic urethra, and the right posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). In addition, three daughter tumors were found on the posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). Random bladder biopsy samples were obtained from the surrounding normal tissue (the posterior, left, and right walls) and the tumor-infiltrated tissue (the bladder neck and prostatic urethra). Subsequently, we deeply resected the largest tumor (Fig. b,c). The right ureteral orifice was exposed, and it was found to have been blocked by papillary tumors (the tumors in the ureter and the ureteral wall are indicated by green and white arrowheads, respectively; Fig. d,e). We deeply resected the tumors in the ureteral orifice; however, after the resection procedure residual tumors were identified within the ureteral orifice (green arrowhead in Figure f), which emitted potent fluorescence under blue light (Fig. g, see also Video ). We decided to attempt to remove the remaining tumors. After the second and third attempts to resect the ureteral tumors (deep resections, Video ), no tumors were visible under white light in the right ureter (Fig. h); however, marked fluorescence was observed from the ureteral mucosa (Fig. i), which was indicative of residual cancer. If the patient had undergone TUR without PDD, we would have finished the surgery at this point. Instead, we performed a biopsy of the fluorescence-emitting tissue. We then attempted to remove the suspected residual carcinoma. After the fourth resection of the ureteral orifice, the hydroureter-affected lumen was exposed, the mucosa of which was smooth and did not emit fluorescence (Fig. j,k). Subsequently, we performed a biopsy of the ureteral mucosa (Video ).\nThe pathological diagnosis of the BT was low-grade urothelial carcinoma, which had not invaded the muscular layer (pTa). No cancer cells were detected in random biopsy specimens. As expected from the PDD, low-grade cancer cells were detected in the ureteral mucosa after the third resection of the ureteral orifice, in which an irregular and fluorescent mucosa was identified (Fig. h,i). On the other hand, no cancer cells were found in the smooth and non-fluorescent mucosa after the fourth resection procedure. To prevent tumor recurrence, the patient is currently being treated with intravesically administered BCG via a right ureteral stent, which exposes both the ureter and the bladder to BCG. We concluded that the ureteral tumor was a BT that had infiltrated into the ureter because (i) preoperative MRI (Fig. a) showed that the main tumor was located in the bladder, (ii) the hydronephrosis was mild (CT findings, Figure ; the hydronephrosis would have been severe if the ureteral tumor had originated from the ureteral orifice), and (iii) the pathological analyses did not show muscular invasion. Thus, we succeeded in resecting the tumor in the ureteral orifice, which was accomplished via PDD using orally administered 5-ALA.", 'Question': "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

 Here is the patient note:
A 37-year-old female patient was referred to Hacettepe University, Pediatric Genetics Department following complaints of atypical facial features. She was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birthweight of 1,500 g (lower than 3rd centile). Her birth length and head circumference were not recorded. The patient had delayed psychomotor development and began to walk and speak after the age of 3 years. She has been able to read and write after attending a rehabilitation program. She was evaluated for developmental delay, short stature, learning disability, recurrent upper respiratory system infections, and constipation in childhood, but no diagnosis was made. Laboratory work-up, including cranial imaging, echocardiography, and blood biochemistry were all normal except for subclinical hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient had generalized anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis since her adolescence and her symptoms had deteriorated over time. She started to suffer from difficulty falling asleep, especially during the last five years. She was described as over-friendly by her family members. On her admission, a physical examination revealed a weight of 42 kg (lower than 3rd centile), a height of 145 cm (lower than 3rd centile), and a head circumference of 52 cm (−2 standard deviations). Among the facial features, a long face, a long neck accentuated by sloping shoulders, low-set ears, periorbital fullness, a short nose, a wide mouth, a small jaw, and malar flattening were noted (). She was talkative and gregarious. The patient exhibited prolonged phases of staring into our faces and maintained eye contact throughout the physical examination. Based on these findings, the patient was clinically diagnosed with Williams syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed 46,XX.ish del(7)(q11.2 q11.2) (ELN-), which confirmed the clinical diagnosis (). Genetic counseling was provided to the family and a follow-up plan was created. An informed consent was obtained from the patient.

 Here is the patient note:
A 51-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for renal biopsy. Proteinuria had been detected when the patient was approximately 30 years of age, and he had experienced tonsillitis several times. The patient had been diagnosed with PV with an abnormality of the JAK2 gene 3 years earlier. Renal biopsy was planned because his proteinuria had become more apparent over the past 2 years.
The patient’s height, weight, and blood pressure were 165 cm, 66 kg, and 120/73 mmHg, respectively. His consciousness level was alert, and he appeared healthy. No remarkable abnormalities were found in the heart, lungs, or abdomen, and pitting edema was not observed.
The laboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin, 15.3 g/dl; hematocrit, 48.1 %; platelets, 326,000/μl; white blood cells, 8,400/μl; C-reactive protein, <0.2 mg/dl; blood urea nitrogen, 22.2 mg/dl; serum creatinine, 1.4 mg/dl; total cholesterol, 194 mg/dl; total protein, 7.1 g/dl; albumin, 4.1 g/dl; globulin, 3.0 g/dl; lactate dehydrogenase, 169 IU/l; aspartate aminotransferase, 17 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase, 23 IU/l; total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dl; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, 21 IU/l; alkaline phosphatase, 276 IU/l; Na, 139 mmol/l; K, 4.7 mmol/l; and Cl, 106 mmol/l. Urinalysis showed 4+ proteinuria (1.2 g/day) and no evidence of hematuria.
Renal biopsy was performed (Fig. ) and 22 glomeruli could be evaluated, 5 of which showed global sclerosis. Histological findings included mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with crescents and focal segmental necrosis. Arteriosclerotic changes were also observed. Immunofluorescence staining was positive and revealed strong immunoreactivity for IgA and C3. Electron microscopy showed electron-dense deposits in the mesangium. He was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. Tonsillectomy plus steroid pulse therapy and an angiotensin II receptor blocker were selected as treatments for the patient. His proteinuria and hematuria disappeared after 6 months.

 Here is the patient note:
An 8-year-old girl arrived at the emergency department with severe respiratory obstruction following interhospital transport. She weighed 42 kg and was 137 cm in height. Treatment for asthma that had been initiated about 1 month before had not improved her respiratory condition. She presented with marked stridor and cough, severe intercostal and subcostal chest retraction, and developed acute respiratory distress. Her parents mentioned that her respiratory condition might have been worsened by an external traumatic event at the neck that had been caused by her younger brother a few months earlier. At that time, while she had been playing with her younger brother, his elbow had bumped into her neck violently.
On admission, computed tomography (CT) of the neck showed that severe subglottic stenosis has developed with minimal cross-sectional diameters of 3.5 × 1.8 mm at the narrowest point (0.05 cm2) (Fig. ). Laryngoscopy revealed that her airway was almost completely obstructed by severe subglottic stenosis. Findings from other preoperative investigations including laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and electrocardiography were normal. The preoperative vital signs were blood pressure of 120/59 mmHg, temperature of 37.5 °C, respiratory rate of 20/min, and SpO2 of 98% (O2 5 L/min via mask). Because the cause of the severe subglottic stenosis was unclear and her symptoms were worsening day by day, we decided to perform emergency tracheostomy to prevent further worsening of her symptoms and a life-threatening condition.
The case was discussed in detail among otolaryngologists and anesthesiologists. Because we anticipated intubation to be impossible, emergency tracheostomy was planned. She was transferred to the operation room for emergency tracheostomy. Intraoperatively, the girl was monitored for oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and non-invasive blood pressure, with electrocardiography performed as well.
We judged that it would be difficult to obtain the patient’s cooperation with only regional anesthesia. Emergent tracheostomy was therefore planned under general anesthesia. Sevoflurane was administered with sufficient titration to maintain spontaneous breathing. Anesthesia was maintained via the inhalation of air, oxygen, and sevoflurane. We considered that the use of a face mask instead of supraglottic airway devices during anesthesia might minimize the risk of tracheal injury or laryngospasm. The lungs were fully preoxygenated. The sevoflurane concentration was increased to 3%, at which point the patient was unresponsive.
The patient initially continued breathing spontaneously, but ventilation later became impossible because the otolaryngologists pulled her trachea. Before the oxygenation and hemodynamics became unstable, tracheostomy was successfully performed by the otolaryngologists. The patient was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for postoperative airway management.
On postoperative day (POD) 3, because her airway had been stabilized by tracheostomy, she was discharged from the PICU. On POD 4, CT of the neck still showed narrowing of the subglottic portion. On POD 7, a laryngoscope under general anesthesia revealed severe edema at the subglottic stenosis (Fig. ). The otolaryngologists considered that the cause of the subglottic stenosis might be edema due to cricoid fracture, given her medical history.
At five months after surgery, a laryngoscope was again inserted under general anesthesia, revealing large granulomas surrounding an object in the subglottic wall. Surprisingly, this object turned out to be a circular plastic foreign body (cross-sectional diameter of 1.2 × 1.0 cm) (Fig. ). Surgery was performed to remove the object. On showing the foreign body to the patient and her parents, they did not remember her aspirating the object. She was discharged from our hospital and placed under home care after removal surgery.

What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².

To calculate the patient's body mass index (BMI), we need to know her weight and height. From the patient note, we know her weight is 42 kg and her height is 137 cm. We can then use the formula BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in meters) squared. First, we need to convert her height from centimeters to meters. 137 cm is equal to 1.37 m. Then, we can plug in the values: BMI = 42 kg / (1.37 m)². This gives us the patient's BMI.

 Here is the patient note:
A 30-year-old G4, P2 female, 160 cm tall, and weighing 68 kg, was admitted at 38 weeks of her third gestation for vaginal bleeding and hypogastralgia at her local hospital. Due to the combination of hypoxemia and abnormal electrocardiograph (ECG) findings, she was advised to transfer to our hospital; the patient did not receive prenatal obstetric care in our hospital. The admitting diagnosis was cardiac insufficiency, cyanotic CHD (dubious) and scarred uterus. The physical examination revealed blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, a pulse of 90/min, a respiratory rate of 25/min, slightly cyanotic lips and the same on her cheeks, coarse breath sounds to auscultation in the lungs, and a regular heartbeat. A loud P2 and grade 3/6 systolic murmur was heard at the third and fourth ribs on the left edge of the sternum. The ECG showed sinus rhythm, complete right bundle branch block (CRBBB), first degree A-V block, inverted T wave, right ventricular hypertrophy, and severe cardiac clockwise rotation.
The obstetricians felt that the manifestations of cardiac insufficiency in the mother put her at high risk in a vaginal delivery. The fetus presented with abnormal heart rate variability, with no further evidence that the fetus was in a state of emergency. Considering that the mother had been in a condition of hypoxia, which would result in hypoxia in the baby, the obstetricians recommended emergency cesarean section for the benefit of both the mother and the baby.
The patient was transferred to the operating theater with a temperature of 36.8 °C, a heart rate of 92 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 23breaths/min, a blood pressure of 138/88 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 83-90% in air. With the administration of a fractional inspired concentration of oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 to 0.6 via a Venturi mask, the patient’s oxygen saturation increased from 88 to 92%. Peripheral venous access was sited, and a 400-ml bolus of compound sodium chloride was commenced, after which a radial arterial line was placed under local anesthesia for beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring.
Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (single-shot spinal anesthesia) was administered in this case. The puncture point of spinal anesthesia was selected in the L2-3 interspace, and the procedure was performed using a needle-through-needle technique in the left lateral decubitus position. After cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be slowly aspirated through the needle, doses of 1.4 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine made up with 10% glucose for a hyperbaric solution that made it easy to adjust and control the anesthetic plane were injected into the subarachnoid space slowly towards the head, and an epidural catheter was inserted into the epidural space. The patient was then placed in the supine position with a left lateral tilt of at least 30 degrees; [] the patient’s abdomen could be raised softly if necessary to relieve vena caval compression. Within 20 min later of the anesthetic injection, we tested the block height every 1-2 min and adjusted the head-up or head-down tilt position to strictly control the blockade under the level of T6-8. Twenty minutes later, the level of spinal block was static at T8. One minute later, the patient was returned to the supine position, with a slight decrease arterial pressure to 122/82 mmHg and a heart rate of 97 beats/min. As small doses of metaraminol could resist the vasodilatation caused by anesthesia to maintain the afterload, 100 μg of metaraminol was administered, after which the patient’s arterial pressure increased to 130/84 mmHg, with a heart rate of 91 beats/min.
During the entire procedure, the key for safely administering anesthesia on such a patient was to keep her blood pressure stable and to carefully address the side effects of the changes in the hemodynamics []. Because the spinal anesthesia took action faster and due to the rapid sympathectomy in the intra-vertebral anesthesia, great care should be taken of the changes in arterial pressure and heart rate after puncture and injection.
A male baby was smoothly delivered 10 min after the surgery began; the baby had Apgar scores of 8 at 1 min and 9 at 5 min. In addition to the caution that must be paid due to the change in the patient’s venous return at the time of the delivery of the baby, some factors need to be given attention to avoid the occurrence of great amounts of intra-cardiac shunt changes and even heart failure. First, because the oppression of the inferior vena cava was relieved after childbirth, the lower limb venous blood flow increased rapidly, and the venous return increased in a short amount of time as a result. Abdominal sandbags were adopted to add pressure to reduce the returned blood volume. Further, the maternal “autologous blood transfusion effect” had to be considered: after the fetus was delivered, the myometrium contracted, and intrauterine blood flowed back to the blood vessels rapidly, thereby increasing the cardiac preload in a short amount of time. If the initial transfusion was too great, it could lead to heart failure. According to the patient’s fluctuations in blood pressure, a bolus of ephedrine 3 mg or metaraminol 100 μg was used to restore the blood pressure to 130 ~ 140/82 ~ 87 mmHg, with a heart rate of 90 ~ 98 beats/min and an SpO2 of 89 ~ 93% during the surgery. The goal was to balance the preload and afterload and to try to maintain the intra-cardiac shunt in the preoperative level of stability.
Uterine atony was noted by the surgeon after delivery of the placenta. Oxytocin is usually administered to increase the contractions so as to reduce bleeding; however, a rapid infusion of oxytocin could increase the patient’s heart rate, reduce the cardiac output and coronary blood flow, and break the balance of the intra-cardiac shunt, which could lead to cardiac insufficiency. Therefore, the application of oxytocin must begin with small doses, and the dosage should be adjusted over time. Thus, oxytocin (10 mIU/min) was intravenously infused, and the infusion was adjusted in accordance with the patient’s changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Continuous post-cesarean analgesia was provided through an epidural catheter. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was then sent to the ward in stable condition the following day.
We advised the patient to have an echocardiogram examination, which revealed CHD, a single atrium, and defects of the endocardial cushions (Fig. ). Thus, we made a complementary diagnosis of CHD: single atrium. The patient was in good condition at the 6-month follow-up.

26.56
To calculate the patient's BMI, we need to know their height and weight. The patient's height is 160 cm, which is equivalent to 1.6 meters. The patient's weight is 68 kg. We can use the formula BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in meters)² to calculate the BMI. First, we convert the height from cm to meters: 160 cm = 1.6 meters. Then, we plug in the values: BMI = 68 kg / (1.6 meters)². Simplifying the calculation, we get BMI = 68 kg / 2.56 m² = 26.56 kg/m².
{'Row Number': 92, 'Calculator Name': 'Body Mass Index (BMI)', 'Calculator ID': '6', 'Category': 'physical', 'Note ID': 'pmc-5576131-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 30-year-old G4, P2 female, 160 cm tall, and weighing 68 kg, was admitted at 38 weeks of her third gestation for vaginal bleeding and hypogastralgia at her local hospital. Due to the combination of hypoxemia and abnormal electrocardiograph (ECG) findings, she was advised to transfer to our hospital; the patient did not receive prenatal obstetric care in our hospital. The admitting diagnosis was cardiac insufficiency, cyanotic CHD (dubious) and scarred uterus. The physical examination revealed blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, a pulse of 90/min, a respiratory rate of 25/min, slightly cyanotic lips and the same on her cheeks, coarse breath sounds to auscultation in the lungs, and a regular heartbeat. A loud P2 and grade 3/6 systolic murmur was heard at the third and fourth ribs on the left edge of the sternum. The ECG showed sinus rhythm, complete right bundle branch block (CRBBB), first degree A-V block, inverted T wave, right ventricular hypertrophy, and severe cardiac clockwise rotation.\nThe obstetricians felt that the manifestations of cardiac insufficiency in the mother put her at high risk in a vaginal delivery. The fetus presented with abnormal heart rate variability, with no further evidence that the fetus was in a state of emergency. Considering that the mother had been in a condition of hypoxia, which would result in hypoxia in the baby, the obstetricians recommended emergency cesarean section for the benefit of both the mother and the baby.\nThe patient was transferred to the operating theater with a temperature of 36.8 °C, a heart rate of 92 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 23breaths/min, a blood pressure of 138/88 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 83-90% in air. With the administration of a fractional inspired concentration of oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 to 0.6 via a Venturi mask, the patient’s oxygen saturation increased from 88 to 92%. Peripheral venous access was sited, and a 400-ml bolus of compound sodium chloride was commenced, after which a radial arterial line was placed under local anesthesia for beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring.\nCombined spinal-epidural anesthesia (single-shot spinal anesthesia) was administered in this case. The puncture point of spinal anesthesia was selected in the L2-3 interspace, and the procedure was performed using a needle-through-needle technique in the left lateral decubitus position. After cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be slowly aspirated through the needle, doses of 1.4 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine made up with 10% glucose for a hyperbaric solution that made it easy to adjust and control the anesthetic plane were injected into the subarachnoid space slowly towards the head, and an epidural catheter was inserted into the epidural space. The patient was then placed in the supine position with a left lateral tilt of at least 30 degrees; [] the patient’s abdomen could be raised softly if necessary to relieve vena caval compression. Within 20 min later of the anesthetic injection, we tested the block height every 1-2 min and adjusted the head-up or head-down tilt position to strictly control the blockade under the level of T6-8. Twenty minutes later, the level of spinal block was static at T8. One minute later, the patient was returned to the supine position, with a slight decrease arterial pressure to 122/82 mmHg and a heart rate of 97 beats/min. As small doses of metaraminol could resist the vasodilatation caused by anesthesia to maintain the afterload, 100 μg of metaraminol was administered, after which the patient’s arterial pressure increased to 130/84 mmHg, with a heart rate of 91 beats/min.\nDuring the entire procedure, the key for safely administering anesthesia on such a patient was to keep her blood pressure stable and to carefully address the side effects of the changes in the hemodynamics []. Because the spinal anesthesia took action faster and due to the rapid sympathectomy in the intra-vertebral anesthesia, great care should be taken of the changes in arterial pressure and heart rate after puncture and injection.\nA male baby was smoothly delivered 10 min after the surgery began; the baby had Apgar scores of 8 at 1 min and 9 at 5 min. In addition to the caution that must be paid due to the change in the patient’s venous return at the time of the delivery of the baby, some factors need to be given attention to avoid the occurrence of great amounts of intra-cardiac shunt changes and even heart failure. First, because the oppression of the inferior vena cava was relieved after childbirth, the lower limb venous blood flow increased rapidly, and the venous return increased in a short amount of time as a result. Abdominal sandbags were adopted to add pressure to reduce the returned blood volume. Further, the maternal “autologous blood transfusion effect” had to be considered: after the fetus was delivered, the myometrium contracted, and intrauterine blood flowed back to the blood vessels rapidly, thereby increasing the cardiac preload in a short amount of time. If the initial transfusion was too great, it could lead to heart failure. According to the patient’s fluctuations in blood pressure, a bolus of ephedrine 3 mg or metaraminol 100 μg was used to restore the blood pressure to 130 ~ 140/82 ~ 87 mmHg, with a heart rate of 90 ~ 98 beats/min and an SpO2 of 89 ~ 93% during the surgery. The goal was to balance the preload and afterload and to try to maintain the intra-cardiac shunt in the preoperative level of stability.\nUterine atony was noted by the surgeon after delivery of the placenta. Oxytocin is usually administered to increase the contractions so as to reduce bleeding; however, a rapid infusion of oxytocin could increase the patient’s heart rate, reduce the cardiac output and coronary blood flow, and break the balance of the intra-cardiac shunt, which could lead to cardiac insufficiency. Therefore, the application of oxytocin must begin with small doses, and the dosage should be adjusted over time. Thus, oxytocin (10 mIU/min) was intravenously infused, and the infusion was adjusted in accordance with the patient’s changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Continuous post-cesarean analgesia was provided through an epidural catheter. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was then sent to the ward in stable condition the following day.\nWe advised the patient to have an echocardiogram examination, which revealed CHD, a single atrium, and defects of the endocardial cushions (Fig. ). Thus, we made a complementary diagnosis of CHD: single atrium. The patient was in good condition at the 6-month follow-up.', 'Question': "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old man with a height of 183 cm and a weight of 105 kg was admitted for urgent resection of a left atrial mass. He presented with progressive heart failure that could not be alleviated by inotropic or vasodilating drugs and had been coughing for 10 days. The symptoms had aggravated, and he had been unable to keep supine position for the last 3 days. He denied any previous heart disease. He had a history of right elbow leiomyosarcoma and underwent resection surgery 1 year previously.
On physical examination, the patient showed orthopnea and a compulsive position of slight left tilting. Wet rales could be heard on bilateral lung base. III/6 diastolic rumble was heard through the apex of the heart, which attenuated with upright position.
The preoperative laboratory data were within normal limits, except for NT-proBNP 1,190 pg/L. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and minor ST segment change. Chest X-ray demonstrated prominent pulmonary patches infiltration, suggesting possible pulmonary edema. A mass was noted on the left lung. Combined with the malignancy history of the patient, pulmonary metastasis was suspected, whereas primary pulmonary tumor could not be ruled out (). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a mobile isoechoic to hyperechoic lumpy mass (54×27 mm, ) and medium pulmonary hypertension (67 mmHg), and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle was 65%.
According to symptoms of left-sided heart failure, signs of mitral stenosis, and ultrasound imaging, myxoma was highly suspected. The TTE image indicated that the mass originated from the posterior wall of the left atrium (the typical myxoma is pedunculated with a stalk commonly attached to the fossa ovalis of interatrial septum). Differential diagnoses included idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), pulmonary embolism, pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is not enough evidence to support the differential diagnoses above.
In the operating room, monitors consisting of noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), five-lead electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) were applied. Radial arterial line and central venous catheter in the right subclavian vein were inserted, and then, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were monitored. Vital signs of the patient were basically stable with continuous intravenous nitroglycerin at the rate of 0.5 μg/kg/min. ABP was 121/82 mmHg, and CVP was 8 cmH2O, while heart rate (HR) was 111 bpm. His SpO2 was 92%–93% (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] 60%). Airway assessment indicated several risk factors: obesity, short neck, impaired neck mobility, and Mallampati classification grade III. When the patient was awake with topical anesthesia of the tongue and pharynx, partial glottis was observed (Cormack–Lehane 2b) with direct laryngoscope. Thus, we considered the mask ventilation was feasible and anesthesia induction was conducted. After preoxygenation with oxygen (10 L/min) for 5 min via a face mask, general anesthesia was induced using Renfushufen® (sufentanil) 1 μg/kg, etomidate 0.15 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (ideal body weight). Orotracheal intubation was performed with video laryngoscope when the patient was kept in the 60° Semi-Fowler’s position to avoid circulation collapse. Because mitral valve occlusion by left atrial mass may result in low cardiac output. Volume-controlled ventilation was applied (tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, frequency adjusted to maintain partial pressure of carbon dioxide in artery [PaCO2] between 35 and 45 mmHg, and inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio 1:2). The airway peak pressure was 28–30 cmH2O. After intubation, the SpO2 was only 90%–93% (FiO2 60%). Arterial gas analysis during surgery is shown in . Abnormalities of airway, breathing, drug effects, and equipment were not found; thus, pulmonary edema was considered as the main reason for hypoxia. FiO2 100% was provided to improve oxygenation. Respiratory rate was increased to enhance minute ventilation volume. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was supplied to prevent alveoli from collapsing to improve pulmonary compliance and gas exchange and to decrease extravascular lung water. PEEP was titrated to 6 cmH2O to avoid high PEEP-related compromise preload. Then, SpO2 improved to 94%–95%. Vital signs and ventilation parameters during surgery are shown in . Anesthesia was maintained with sufentanil 20 μg/h and sevoflurane 2%–2.5% (concentration of sevoflurane was adjusted according to the patient’s increased age), and rocuronium was given intermittently.
After median sternotomy, 400 U/kg heparin was administered. Arterial cannulation was performed via ascending aorta. Venous cannulation was inserted via the right atrial appendage into the superior and inferior vena cava. After CPB was established, oxygenation of the patient improved significantly with the SpO2 improved to 99%–100%. The patient was kept anesthetized with midazolam 0.1 mg/kg/h, sufentanil 0.15 μg/kg/h, and rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg/h intravenously under hypothermic CPB, and nasopharyngeal and rectal temperature were maintained at 25°C and 28°C, respectively. Activated clotting time (ACT) was performed intermittently, and the results are shown in .
Under direct view, the mass was large and occupied nearly the entire left atrium. The right atrium and atrial septum were incised, and the mass was found attached by a stalk to the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein. The mass in the left atrium was totally resected, and was 15×2 cm. The tumor in the left superior pulmonary vein could not be completely resected, and palliative resection of the tumor around the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein was performed to ease tumor-related symptoms. As a result, preload was improved while pulmonary hypertension remained a problem. After rewarming and deairing of the heart, the aortic cross-clamp was removed. The heart came back into sinus rhythm with 20J intracardiac defibrillation, and then, the CPB was discontinued gradually. Weaning was facilitated with norepinephrine 0.05 μg/kg/min and dopamine 5 μg/kg/min to achieve goal mean arterial BP.65 mmHg. Nitroglycerin 0.5–0.8 μg/kg/min was used to decrease systemic vascular resistance. A total of 800 mL of packed red blood cells were gradually infused to increase preload. Vital signs showed an ABP of 110/70 mmHg, an HR of 110 bpm, a CVP of 12 cmH2O, and an SpO2 of 93%–95%. Heparin was neutralized with protamine (1 mg/100 U heparin). The total CPB time was 100 min, and the aortic occlusion time was 85 min. The overall fluid balance during CPB was −2,700 mL. The estimated blood loss was 800 mL. Arterial blood gas analysis after CPB discontinuation is also showed in .
After CPB, the partial pressure of oxygen in artery (PaO2) was 68 mmHg with FiO2 100% and PEEP 6 cmH2O and was increased from that before tumor resection (48 mmHg). After excluding bronchospasm and acute lung injury, we assumed that this was due to unrelieved cardiogenic pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension, as well as residual tumor in the pulmonary vessels. Inotropic agents including epinephrine 0.05 μg/kg/min, dopamine 5 μg/kg/min, and nitroglycerin 0.5–0.8 μg/kg/min were continuously used to improve cardiac output and facilitate stable hemodynamics, so as to alleviate pulmonary edema. Hyperventilation was applied to decrease PaCO2 and prevent acidosis. Hypoxia pulmonary vasoconstriction may have been partially inhibited, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure was decreased from 67 to <35 mmHg (postoperative TTE). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with BP 110/71 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, and SpO2 95% during admission. Oxygenation was improved compared to the level before left atrial tumor resection (91 vs 48 mmHg), and HR was decreased (103 vs 111 bpm), indicating that pulmonary edema was partially relieved. Increasing FiO2, decreasing O2 consumption, and optimizing acid–base balance and hemoglobin, together with protective ventilation, were provided and resulted in oxygenation improvement. Vasoactive medications and mechanical ventilation were gradually weaned, and vital signs remained stable. Chest X-ray performed 3 h postoperatively revealed significantly relieved pulmonary edema (). The patient was extubated on postoperative day 4 while he was conscious, and the vital signs showed BP 121/72 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, and SpO2 95%–97% with FiO2 85%. He was discharged 10 days after the surgery with symptoms ameliorated and SpO2 97% with FiO2 21%. Histopathological examination of the resected lesion revealed features consistent with leiomyosarcoma. Further management of the lung metastasis of leiomyosarcoma and possible radiation therapy are needed. Some authors suggest that multimodal therapy (surgical resection, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy) may result in reasonable survival improvement for patients. Isambert et al reported a mean survival of 18.2 months after incomplete resection and 11.2 months in nonresected patients. In our case, the patient received palliative treatment after surgery and died of tumor-related cardiopulmonary failure 6 months later. The timeline of history, interventions, and outcomes are summarized in .
Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s next of kin for publication of this case report.

The heart came back into sinus rhythm with 20J intracardiac defibrillation, and then, the CPB was discontinued gradually. Weaning was facilitated with norepinephrine 0.05 μg/kg/min and dopamine 5 μg/kg/min to achieve goal mean arterial BP.65 mmHg. Nitroglycerin 0.5–0.8 μg/kg/min was used to decrease systemic vascular resistance. A total of 800 mL of packed red blood cells were gradually infused to increase preload. Vital signs showed an ABP of 110/70 mmHg, an HR of 110 bpm, a CVP of 12 cmH2O, and an SpO2 of 93%–95%. Heparin was neutralized with protamine (1 mg/100 U heparin). The total CPB time was 100 min, and the aortic occlusion time was 85 min. The overall fluid balance during CPB was −2,700 mL. The estimated blood loss was 800 mL. Arterial blood gas analysis after CPB discontinuation is also showed in . After CPB, the partial pressure of oxygen in artery (PaO2) was 68 mmHg with FiO2 100% and PEEP 6 cmH2O and was increased from that before tumor resection (48 mmHg). After excluding bronchospasm and acute lung injury, we assumed that this was due to unrelieved cardiogenic pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension, as well as residual tumor in the pulmonary vessels. Inotropic agents including epinephrine 0.05 μg/kg/min, dopamine 5 μg/kg/min, and nitroglycerin 0.5–0.8 μg/kg/min were continuously used to improve cardiac output and facilitate stable hemodynamics, so as to alleviate pulmonary edema. Hyperventilation was applied to decrease PaCO2 and prevent acidosis. Hypoxia pulmonary vasoconstriction may have been partially inhibited, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure was decreased from 67 to <35 mmHg (postoperative TTE). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with BP 110/71 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, and SpO2 95% during admission. Oxygenation was improved compared to the level before left atrial tumor resection (91 vs 48 mmHg), and HR was decreased (103 vs 111 bpm), indicating that pulmonary edema was partially relieved. Increasing FiO2, decreasing O2 consumption, and optimizing acid–base balance and hemoglobin, together with protective ventilation, were provided and resulted in oxygenation improvement. Vasoactive medications and mechanical ventilation were gradually weaned, and vital signs remained stable. Chest X-ray performed 3 h postoperatively revealed significantly relieved pulmonary edema (). The patient was extubated on postoperative day 4 while he was conscious, and the vital signs showed BP 121/72 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, and SpO2 95%–97% with FiO2 85%. He was discharged 10 days after the surgery with symptoms ameliorated and SpO2 97% with FiO2 21%. Histopathological examination of the resected lesion revealed features consistent with leiomyosarcoma. Further management of the lung metastasis of leiomyosarcoma and possible radiation therapy are needed. Some authors suggest that multimodal therapy (surgical resection, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy) may result in reasonable survival improvement for patients. Isambert et al reported a mean survival of 18.2 months after incomplete resection and 11.2 months in nonresected patients. In our case, the patient received palliative treatment after surgery and died of tumor-related cardiopulmonary failure 6 months later. The timeline of history, interventions, and outcomes are summarized in . Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s next of kin for publication of this case report.

First, we need to calculate the patient's height in meters. Since the patient's height is 183 cm, we can convert it to meters by dividing by 100. Then, we need to calculate the patient's weight in kilograms. Since the patient's weight is 105 kg, we don't need to convert it. Next, we need to calculate the patient's BMI by dividing the patient's weight in kilograms by the square of the patient's height in meters. Finally, we can calculate the patient's BMI in kg/m².
{'Row Number': 93, 'Calculator Name': 'Body Mass Index (BMI)', 'Calculator ID': '6', 'Category': 'physical', 'Note ID': 'pmc-5783153-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 67-year-old man with a height of 183 cm and a weight of 105 kg was admitted for urgent resection of a left atrial mass. He presented with progressive heart failure that could not be alleviated by inotropic or vasodilating drugs and had been coughing for 10 days. The symptoms had aggravated, and he had been unable to keep supine position for the last 3 days. He denied any previous heart disease. He had a history of right elbow leiomyosarcoma and underwent resection surgery 1 year previously.\nOn physical examination, the patient showed orthopnea and a compulsive position of slight left tilting. Wet rales could be heard on bilateral lung base. III/6 diastolic rumble was heard through the apex of the heart, which attenuated with upright position.\nThe preoperative laboratory data were within normal limits, except for NT-proBNP 1,190 pg/L. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and minor ST segment change. Chest X-ray demonstrated prominent pulmonary patches infiltration, suggesting possible pulmonary edema. A mass was noted on the left lung. Combined with the malignancy history of the patient, pulmonary metastasis was suspected, whereas primary pulmonary tumor could not be ruled out (). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a mobile isoechoic to hyperechoic lumpy mass (54×27 mm, ) and medium pulmonary hypertension (67 mmHg), and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle was 65%.\nAccording to symptoms of left-sided heart failure, signs of mitral stenosis, and ultrasound imaging, myxoma was highly suspected. The TTE image indicated that the mass originated from the posterior wall of the left atrium (the typical myxoma is pedunculated with a stalk commonly attached to the fossa ovalis of interatrial septum). Differential diagnoses included idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), pulmonary embolism, pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is not enough evidence to support the differential diagnoses above.\nIn the operating room, monitors consisting of noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), five-lead electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) were applied. Radial arterial line and central venous catheter in the right subclavian vein were inserted, and then, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were monitored. Vital signs of the patient were basically stable with continuous intravenous nitroglycerin at the rate of 0.5 μg/kg/min. ABP was 121/82 mmHg, and CVP was 8 cmH2O, while heart rate (HR) was 111 bpm. His SpO2 was 92%–93% (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] 60%). Airway assessment indicated several risk factors: obesity, short neck, impaired neck mobility, and Mallampati classification grade III. When the patient was awake with topical anesthesia of the tongue and pharynx, partial glottis was observed (Cormack–Lehane 2b) with direct laryngoscope. Thus, we considered the mask ventilation was feasible and anesthesia induction was conducted. After preoxygenation with oxygen (10 L/min) for 5 min via a face mask, general anesthesia was induced using Renfushufen® (sufentanil) 1 μg/kg, etomidate 0.15 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (ideal body weight). Orotracheal intubation was performed with video laryngoscope when the patient was kept in the 60° Semi-Fowler’s position to avoid circulation collapse. Because mitral valve occlusion by left atrial mass may result in low cardiac output. Volume-controlled ventilation was applied (tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, frequency adjusted to maintain partial pressure of carbon dioxide in artery [PaCO2] between 35 and 45 mmHg, and inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio 1:2). The airway peak pressure was 28–30 cmH2O. After intubation, the SpO2 was only 90%–93% (FiO2 60%). Arterial gas analysis during surgery is shown in . Abnormalities of airway, breathing, drug effects, and equipment were not found; thus, pulmonary edema was considered as the main reason for hypoxia. FiO2 100% was provided to improve oxygenation. Respiratory rate was increased to enhance minute ventilation volume. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was supplied to prevent alveoli from collapsing to improve pulmonary compliance and gas exchange and to decrease extravascular lung water. PEEP was titrated to 6 cmH2O to avoid high PEEP-related compromise preload. Then, SpO2 improved to 94%–95%. Vital signs and ventilation parameters during surgery are shown in . Anesthesia was maintained with sufentanil 20 μg/h and sevoflurane 2%–2.5% (concentration of sevoflurane was adjusted according to the patient’s increased age), and rocuronium was given intermittently.\nAfter median sternotomy, 400 U/kg heparin was administered. Arterial cannulation was performed via ascending aorta. Venous cannulation was inserted via the right atrial appendage into the superior and inferior vena cava. After CPB was established, oxygenation of the patient improved significantly with the SpO2 improved to 99%–100%. The patient was kept anesthetized with midazolam 0.1 mg/kg/h, sufentanil 0.15 μg/kg/h, and rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg/h intravenously under hypothermic CPB, and nasopharyngeal and rectal temperature were maintained at 25°C and 28°C, respectively. Activated clotting time (ACT) was performed intermittently, and the results are shown in .\nUnder direct view, the mass was large and occupied nearly the entire left atrium. The right atrium and atrial septum were incised, and the mass was found attached by a stalk to the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein. The mass in the left atrium was totally resected, and was 15×2 cm. The tumor in the left superior pulmonary vein could not be completely resected, and palliative resection of the tumor around the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein was performed to ease tumor-related symptoms. As a result, preload was improved while pulmonary hypertension remained a problem. After rewarming and deairing of the heart, the aortic cross-clamp was removed. The heart came back into sinus rhythm with 20J intracardiac defibrillation, and then, the CPB was discontinued gradually. Weaning was facilitated with norepinephrine 0.05 μg/kg/min and dopamine 5 μg/kg/min to achieve goal mean arterial BP.65 mmHg. Nitroglycerin 0.5–0.8 μg/kg/min was used to decrease systemic vascular resistance. A total of 800 mL of packed red blood cells were gradually infused to increase preload. Vital signs showed an ABP of 110/70 mmHg, an HR of 110 bpm, a CVP of 12 cmH2O, and an SpO2 of 93%–95%. Heparin was neutralized with protamine (1 mg/100 U heparin). The total CPB time was 100 min, and the aortic occlusion time was 85 min. The overall fluid balance during CPB was −2,700 mL. The estimated blood loss was 800 mL.

To calculate the patient's body mass index (BMI), we need to know the patient's weight in kilograms and height in meters. From the patient note, we know the patient's weight is 50 kg and height is 143 cm. First, we need to convert the height from centimeters to meters. 143 cm is equal to 1.43 m. Then, we can calculate the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in m)². BMI = 50 kg / (1.43 m)². Finally, we can simplify the calculation to get the BMI.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient was a 17-year-old boy with hypopituitarism, autism, and a history of septooptic dysplasia with whom communication was difficult. He was receiving treatment with dexamethasone 100 μg and Levothyroxine sodium 1 mg per day. One month before admission, he experienced a fall, which resulted in difficulty in walking. At the first visit to the physician, because he could not describe any symptoms, only knee radiography was performed and there were no abnormalities. The pain in his right leg progressively worsened and he presented to our outpatient clinic after one month.
On physical examination, the patient was slightly obese with a height of 161 cm and weight of 63 kg noted. His right leg was externally rotated, and he hesitated to stand up. The passive range of motion of the right hip was limited, especially in adduction and internal rotation (right/left; flexion 90°/120°, extension 10°/10°, abduction 45°/45°, adduction 0°/30°, external rotation 60°/45°, and internal rotation 10°/30°). Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 levels were low, but free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were almost normal. The radiographs of the hip joints showed a right atypical slippage of the epiphysis (). Both neck shaft angles were large (right/left; 160°/155°) and lateral tilts of the physis were normal on intact side (right/left; 35° lateral/13° medial). Three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) images showed lateral epiphyseal displacement on the right femoral head (Figures and ), indicating valgus SCFE.
The patient underwent in situ pinning of the hip on both sides. On the right side, the procedure was performed through a limited 5 cm longitudinal incision, positioned medially on the thigh (frog position), posterior to the femoral neurovascular bundle. A single φ5.5 mm partially threaded cannulated screw (Meira, Japan) was placed across the physis. In situ pinning on the left side was performed as a prophylactic pinning because of endocrine abnormalities (). Postoperatively, we had difficulty in limiting weight bearing due to communication difficulties.
One month after surgery, he could walk better than before the operation. At the 1-year follow-up, he could walk without difficulty and there were no signs of pain. The passive range of motion of the right hip joint was slightly improved in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (100°, 20°, and 20°, resp.). Radiographs showed no signs of avascular necrosis or chondrolysis of the epiphysis; the physis showed no signs of early partial closure.

What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².

 Here is the patient note:
A 12-yr-old female presented to our outpatient department with a right winged scapula. Her height was 139 cm and her weight was 38 kg. This condition abruptly developed after climbing a mountain for 2 hr with a rucksack/back-pack weighing about 20 kg at 2 months previous to her hospital visit. At a certain moment, she felt the drooping shoulder with a popping sound. She was born via spontaneous full-term vaginal delivery with a normal APGAR score. She had no specific family history of nerve or muscle diseases. Her growth and developmental history was nonspecific before the onset of winged scapula. Upon the physical examination, a winging deformity of the right scapula was noticed with the lateral deviation and upward rotation of the inferior angle, as observed on the erect neutral posture (). This abnormality was not detected when both shoulders were abducted (), but it was aggravated by shoulder flexion (). The motor and sensory functions of the upper extremities were normal and no side to side differences were revealed. The deep tendon reflexes of the biceps and triceps muscles were normoactive and symmetrical. No significant muscle atrophy in the shoulder girdles and the upper extremities was observed. On the laboratory tests, the routine complete blood count with differential counting, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid arthritis factor and urinalysis were normal, and the muscle enzyme tests, including serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and transaminase, were also normal. Simple radiological studies, including the chest posterior-anterior view, both the shoulder anterior-posterior views and the scapular view, were nonspecific except for the slight scapular asymmetry.
We examined the nerves by conducting an electrodiagnostic examination that included the long thoracic nerve, the dorsal scapular nerve and the spinal accessory nerves and the muscles including serratus anterior, levator scapula, trapezius and rhomboideus and so on; there were no definitive evidences that indicated any neuropathy or myopathy on electrodiagnosis.
When the pain and functional impairment persisted, surgical intervention then became appropriate. An explorative operation was done. A posterior longitudinal skin incision was made parallel to the vertebral border of the scapula. The subcutaneous tissue was divided. We can observed that the rhomboidius major was ruptured and trapezius lower thoracic bundle displayed thinning (). The right scapula was unstable to the chest wall. Rhomboideus major and trapezius muscle repair and reefing were performed. After the muscle repair, the scapula was stable to chest wall at the time of the operation.
Postoperatively, she achieved the anatomical restoration of her right shoulder and she received rehabilitative treatment for 2 weeks including range of motion exercise of the shoulder and strengthening exercise of the rhomboideus muscles. On the follow up examination, at 2 months after the operation, there was no weakness or deformity of the affected shoulder and no pain nor limitation of shoulder motion. She was satisfied with the recovery of her shoulder function ().

 Here is the patient note:
The subject was a 14-year-old female patient with EDS hypermobile type. She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().
EDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.
The AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.
In the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.
The intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.

She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. The patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] (). EDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs. The AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week.

 Here is the patient note:
We describe a 20-year-old male from the Mbuyuni area of northern Tanzania who presented to Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) in January 2020 with weight loss, splenomegaly, severe cachexia, and watery diarrhea. However, the leading symptom on presentation was watery diarrhea for 3 weeks.
The patient was accompanied by his father who reported that his son suffered from cachexia starting age 17. Prior to age 17, his medical history was unremarkable. His parents and 7 siblings are all healthy.
At the time of initial symptom onset, the patent lived in the Simanjiro district for cattle herding, while the rest of his family members lived in the suburban area of Arusha. He reported several insect bites during his period of working as a cattle herder. His symptoms gradually worsened with increasing weight loss and splenomegaly and as well as skin rashes and maculae in his face. After a year, he sought treatment from traditional healers. After another year of no improvement from consultation of the traditional healer, he presented to an outside hospital in the Arusha region (unknown diagnostic and treatment approach). Eventually, he was admitted at KCMC for further diagnostics.
On admission to KCMC, the patient’s primary complaints were abdominal pain and swelling. The laboratory tests on admission revealed white blood count of 1.51 × 109/L (neutrophils 37.3%, lymphocytes 58.4%, monocytes 3.7%, eosinophils 0.4%, and basophils 0.2%), red blood cell count 2.21 × 1012/L, hemoglobin 4.9 g/dL, thrombocytes 56 × 109/L, creatinine 41 μmol/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 12.9 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 7.6 U/L, sodium 124.6 mmol/L, potassium 2.9 mmol/L, and chloride 106 mmol/L. HIV test result is negative. The sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for tuberculosis (GenXpert, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California, United States of America) was negative; a chest X-ray investigation was normal; and ultrasound of the abdomen revealed hepatosplenomegaly.
On physical exam, he appeared pale and was wasted with a body weight of 39 kg and a height of 172 cm. On abdominal exam, his spleen was enlarged 18 cm below costal margin; the liver was enlarged 3 cm below costal margin; there were traditional healer marks throughout the abdomen; there were no palpable lymph nodes; and the lungs and heart were normal. His skin exam demonstrated hypopigmented maculae scattered on his face with accentuation in the perioral region () and skin-colored maculae on his trunk and arms. The latter occurred a few months before presentation in the hospital. Alopecia areata was also noted.
His travel history includes a 3-month stay in Mombasa (Kenya), approximately 1 year prior to presentation, where he worked as a merchant. Travels to other areas in Kenya or other countries, especially to endemic VL areas, has been denied by the patient as well as travels within Tanzania.
Due to pancytopenia, the patient was referred to the Hematology section of the Cancer Care Centre at KCMC, where we performed bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, revealing Leishmania amastigotes in macrophages (Figs and ). The rapid test for Leishmania antibody detection (IT LEISH) from the peripheral blood and the bone marrow aspirate remained negative.
After discussion with senior experts in tropical diseases, we decided to reperform bone marrow aspiration for PCR in a reference laboratory, which found the aspirate positive for Leishmania species DNA.
Due to the unavailability of liposomal Amphotericin, we initiated treatment with Amphotericin B (1 mg/kg IV). Unfortunately, the patient passed away on the fourth day of treatment due to sudden onset of respiratory insufficiency. Beside evidence of massive organ manifestations of VL (Figs –), the autopsy revealed pneumonia ().

Upon physical examination, percussion sounds over the left lower thorax were a bit dull and cervical lymph nodes were palpable with a size of up to 1 cm. The abdomen was generally tender without signs of peritonitis; bowel sounds were normal. The ECG showed no abnormalities. Routine laboratory tests revealed mild leucocytosis and a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level. Troponin, myoglobine, and creatine kinase levels were within normal limits. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. Whereas the oesophagus, the lower stomach, and the duodenum were
without abnormalities, a small hole in the fundus was visible after inversion of the scope ().
The “hole in the stomach” was intubated with a catheter and contrast dye was administered. Fluoroscopy revealed a diaphragmatic hernia with a large herniation of the gastric fundus (). Immediate laparotomy showed a 3 cm orifice of the
diaphragm (). The orifice was widened and a partial necrosis of the incarcerated fundus was resected (). The diaphragmatic orifice was covered with polydioxanone. The patient recovered fully and 
was discharged 12 days after laparotomy.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².

18.52
To calculate the patient's BMI, we need to know their height and weight. The patient's height is given as 180 cm, which is equivalent to 1.8 meters. The patient's weight is given as 60 kg. We can then use the formula BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in meters)² to calculate the BMI. First, we convert the height from meters to meters² by squaring it: 1.8² = 3.24. Then, we divide the patient's weight (60 kg) by their height in meters² (3.24): 60 kg / 3.24 m² = 18.52.

 Here is the patient note:
A 3-year-old girl visited the Emergency Department because she had not been able to eat well and had a fever since one day ago. She had no abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. She had taken only the prescribed acetaminophen one day before. According to her past medical history, she went to kindergarten, had not traveled recently, had no history of pancreatitis, autoimmune disease, choledochal cyst, or pancreatic ductal abnormalities, and her family history was negative for pancreatic disease. She has one older sister, and her sister did not have symptoms such as fever. Her vital signs at admission were as follows: blood pressure, 97/60 mmHg; heart rate, 104 beats/min; respiration rate, 24 breaths/min; and body temperature, 37.4℃. Her height was 98 cm (50th–75th percentile), and her weight was 15 kg (50th–75th percentile). On physical examination, multiple vesicles on the soft palate and maculopapular rashes were observed on both the hands and feet. She had a clear breathing sound, regular heartbeat without murmur, and soft abdomen with a normoactive bowel sound without an abdominal mass or abdominal tenderness. In initial laboratory studies, the serum glucose was decreased (41 mg/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate was slightly increased (17 mm/hr; reference range, 0–10 mm/hr), and C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (12.9 mg/L; reference range, 0.0–5.0 mg/L), and other laboratory studies were within the normal ranges. The white blood cell count was 7.8×103/µL, hemoglobin was 12.6 g/dL, platelet count was 252×103/µL, blood urea nitrogen was 15.0 mg/dL, creatinine was 0.42 mg/dL, cholesterol was 187 mg/dL, albumin was 4.3 g/dL, total bilirubin was 0.39 mg/dL, direct bilirubin was 0.11 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase was 34 IU/L, alanine aminotransaminase was 10 IU/L, sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 4.4 mmol/L. Amylase and lipase tests were not performed at the time of admission. Urine ketone body was 3 positive in urinalysis. A chest X-ray showed no active lung lesions, cardiopulmonary angle blunting, or cardiomegaly. Abdomen X-rays showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern without ileus or pancreatic calcification.
We treated the child conservatively with intravenous fluid. On the first hospital day (HD), her fever subsided. On the third HD, she complained of ear pain caused by acute otitis media and intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanate was administered at a dose of 90 mg/kg/day. On the fourth HD, she experienced severe epigastric pain and vomiting. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 107/80 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min.; respiration rate, 24 breaths/min; and body temperature, 37.2℃. On physical examination, she complained of epigastric tenderness. The serum levels of amylase and lipase were remarkably elevated (amylase, 1,902 IU/L; reference range, 28–100 IU/L; lipase, >1,500 IU/L; reference range, 13–60 IU/L). Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed mild diffuse swelling of the pancreas from head to tail with a small amount of ascites (), which suggested acute pancreatitis.
Considering the patient's history of HFMD, we thought that enterovirus, which is a common cause of HFMD, could be a pathogen. We asked the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for enterovirus typing of her stool sample. In the first step, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on the specimens targeting the 5' noncoding region capable of detecting all 68 serotypes, and the result was enterovirus-positive. In the second step, 2-step RT-PCR was performed targeting viral protein 1, which has a different structural enterovirus protein for each subtype, and CA16 was detected in the sample.
After acute pancreatitis was diagnosed, the patient was fasted and given sufficient intravenous fluid. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were given for pain control. Serum amylase and lipase were serially followed (). The fever, epigastric pain, and vomiting were recovered on the sixth HD. She was discharged on the 11th HD without pancreatitis-related complications. On the day of discharge, the serum levels of amylase and lipase were remarkably reduced (amylase, 289 IU/L; lipase, 893 IU/L).
She was followed up after discharge without any symptoms, and pancreatitis has not recurred yet. Laboratory tests performed 6 months after discharge showed normal levels of serum amylase and lipase ().

Here is the task:
What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².

 Here is the patient note:
An 86-year-old male previously treated for hypertension presented to the emergency department with two days of sudden abdominal pain and nausea which resolved temporarily after self-induced emesis. Patient was examined and investigated thoroughly. Temperature was 36.3 C, blood pressure was 138/81, and pulse was 78. Physical examination revealed a tender, firm and distended abdomen with hyperactive sounds. Laboratory analysis revealed hemoglobin at 10.3 g/dL, leukocytes 3.1 K/cmm, urea nitrogen 19 mg/dl, creatinine 0.6 mg/dl, sodium 137 mmol/l, potassium 3.6 mmol/l, chloride 104 mmol/l, bicarbonate 24 mmol/l, calcium 8.6 mg/dl, total protein 6.3 g/dl, albumin 3.1 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 98 U/l, SGOT 20 U/l, SGPT 27 U/l. Laboratory values were consistent with patient’s previous clinic visits. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a fluid-filled, significantly dilated stomach as well as multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels consistent with mechanical small bowel obstruction caused by intussusception of small bowel (Fig. ). After initial fluid resuscitation and antibiotic administration, consent was obtained for emergent exploratory laparotomy. The exploratory laparotomy revealed a 3.0 × 2.5 cm intraluminal calculus in the ileum responsible for the small bowel obstruction, without evidence of intussusception (Fig. ). The obstructing enterolith was ‘milked’ proximally until it reached, and subsequently ‘fell into,’ an isolated 6.0 × 3.0 cm jejunal diverticulum which had not been previously noted on CT imaging. The enterolith was removed along with the segment of the jejunum containing the isolated diverticulum, which was the source of the enterolith (Fig. ). On histologic examination, the mucosa of the extracted diverticulum was found to be granular and erythematous; the remaining small bowel had marked mucosal ulceration and near-transmural inflammation with granulation tissue. Hospital course was complicated by decreased urine output that resolved after fluid resuscitation. On the fourth postoperative day, nasogastric tube was discontinued, diet was advanced and tolerated, and the patient was discharged. Review of the patient’s CT scan of the abdomen revealed the isolated jejunal diverticulum that was consistent with the excised diverticulum (Fig. ).

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male veteran presented with recurrent syncope and falls. He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.
Initial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.
The etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.
Concurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.

 Here is the patient note:
A 78-year-old man presented with dyspnea on exertion. He had undergone resection of a left atrial myxoma 4 years prior to admission. He had a history of diabetes mellitus with onset at the age of 60; at the age of 71, he started undergoing dialysis for chronic renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy. He also had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and was undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer. He had never smoked and his family history was unremarkable. He became aware of dyspnea on exertion in the previous 2 months, and was admitted to our hospital because his condition worsened. UCG revealed that the LVEF had decreased sharply from 73 to 44% (New York Heart Association class III). In this case, the inflammatory response remained low and stable at C-reactive protein levels of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/dL until the second operation.
His height and weight were 170.0 cm and 64.4 kg, respectively. His blood pressure was 86/48 mmHg and heart rate was 70 bpm (normal sinus rhythm). His laboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin, 10.2 g/dL; platelet count, 132 × 109/L; total protein, 5.7 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 mg/dL; triglycerides, 54 mg/dL; LDL-cholesterol, 44 mg/dL; HDL-cholesterol, 44 mg/dL; Ca, 8.1 mg/dL; P, 3.1 mg/dL; HbA1c, 7.0%; and BNP, 3461 pg/mL. His oral medications included aspirin (100 mg/day), furosemide (20 mg/day), carvedilol (2.5 mg/day), lansoprazole (15 mg/day), precipitated calcium carbonate (3000 mg/day), rosuvastatin calcium (5 mg/day), and nicorandil (15 mg/day).
ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF, and ST segment depression in V5-V6 (Fig. ). Chest radiography and CT revealed a CTR of 72% and severe calcified coronary arteries (Fig. ). UCG revealed poor left ventricular function (LVDd/Ds, 56/43 mm; LVEF, 44%; inferoposterior wall hypokinesis; and mild MR with RVP of 29 mmHg). Cineangiography 4 years ago had shown only 25% stenosis in the proximal LAD; at admission, it revealed 90% stenosis in the same proximal LAD, 99% stenosis in the proximal LCX, and 95% stenosis in the posterolateral branch (PL) of LCX (Fig. a, b).

He had undergone resection of a left atrial myxoma 4 years prior to admission. He had a history of diabetes mellitus with onset at the age of 60; at the age of 71, he started undergoing dialysis for chronic renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy. He also had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and was undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer. He had never smoked and his family history was unremarkable. He became aware of dyspnea on exertion in the previous 2 months, and was admitted to our hospital because his condition worsened. UCG revealed that the LVEF had decreased sharply from 73 to 44% (New York Heart Association class III). In this case, the inflammatory response remained low and stable at C-reactive protein levels of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/dL until the second operation. His height and weight were 170.0 cm and 64.4 kg, respectively. His blood pressure was 86/48 mmHg and heart rate was 70 bpm (normal sinus rhythm). His laboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin, 10.2 g/dL; platelet count, 132 × 109/L; total protein, 5.7 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 mg/dL; triglycerides, 54 mg/dL; LDL-cholesterol, 44 mg/dL; HDL-cholesterol, 44 mg/dL; Ca, 8.1 mg/dL; P, 3.1 mg/dL; HbA1c, 7.0%; and BNP, 3461 pg/mL.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with complaints of chronic weakness, fatigue, myalgia, weight loss, and left flank pain. Comorbidities included hypertension, active smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Patient denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, or any shortness of breath. He had a recent admission due to community acquired pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics. He denied using any illicit drugs or alcohol abuse. He was retired truck driver by profession.
On examination, he was an elderly man with clinical signs of dehydration. Blood pressure was 155/56 mm Hg, heart rate was 67/min, respiratory rate was 16/min, was afebrile, and his oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. He had mild epigastric tenderness without guarding or rigidity. He had bilateral lower extremities chronic skin changes with scaling. The rest of the physical examination was normal.
Significant laboratory data revealed serum sodium 124 mEq/mL, potassium 5.1 mEq/mL, chloride 89 mEq/mL, bicarbonate 15 mEq/mL, blood urea nitrogen 44 mg/dL, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, glucose 85 mg/dL, calcium 10.3 mg/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, and albumin 2.9 g/dL. The rest of the liver function tests were within normal limit. Anemia was with hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, hematocrit 27%, platelets 558 k/μL, and white blood cells 10.4 k/μL. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 25 mm Hg, pO2 of 90.3 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. There was an anion gap of 20, lactic acid of 4.8 mmoles/L, serum lipase of 1540 U/L, amylase 406 unit/L, gamma GT 25 unit/L, INR 1.3, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 950 unit/L; cancer antigen CA 19-9 was 49.9 μ/mL, TSH was 2.25 mIU/L, serum acetone was negative, and alcohol level was less than 10 mg/dL. His serial cardiac enzymes were negative and he was ruled out for an acute coronary event.
Chest X-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral patchy airspace disease. CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with homogeneous attenuation and without significant peripancreatic inflammation () with extensive retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy (). A para-aortic lymph node measuring 2.1 cm and retrocaval lymph node measuring 1.6 cm were seen. A soft tissue density surrounding the right common iliac vessels likely representing confluent adenopathy was seen. His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 67%; right ventricle systolic pressure was estimated to be 44 mm Hg. Pericardium was normal without any pericardial effusion. There was no significant valvular abnormality.
Initially, the patients EKG showed 2nd degree Mobitz type I block which later progressed to complete heart block. Patient was given atropine without improvement; hence, a temporary pacemaker was inserted. He was started on IV hydration and IV antibiotics and all his electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. His temporary pacemaker lead came out and it was removed. Subsequently he became unresponsive, was orally intubated, had four cardiac arrests, and was successfully resuscitated. Due to persistent pulmonary infiltrates he underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies which showed evidence of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). He was started on Bactrim for the treatment of PJP. He tested positive for HIV and was found to have a CD 4 count of 12/uL.
A temporary pacemaker wire was again placed after ruling out the relevant reversible causes of third degree heart block. A repeat echocardiogram was unchanged from prior one. CT-guided biopsy of the para-aortic lymph nodes was consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with marked tumor necrosis (). Immunoprofile showed that CD 20 (), CD 79a, and CD 10 were positive. CD 43, CD 3, CD 7, and BcL were negative. Upper endoscopy for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement showed gastric polyps which revealed gastric lymphoma on biopsy.
Patient was not a candidate for chemotherapy or ART due to critical condition. Hospital course was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and eventual death a month into his hospital stay.

 Here is the patient note:
A 56-year old man presented to the Department of Internal Medicine with a deteriorated mental status. Laboratory tests performed in the emergency department demonstrated severe hypercalcemia at 17.95 mg/dl (reference range: 8.7–10.4), together with albumin levels of 3.2 g/dl, elevated levels of phosphor 5.9 mg/dl (reference range: 2.5–5), acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.45 mg/dl (baseline creatinine level 0.9 mg/dl), urea, 73 mg/dl, uric acid, 12.8 mg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate 52 ml/minute, hemoglobin 11 mg/dl, and C-reactive protein 0.8 mg/dl. He was treated with an intravenous saline infusion, subcutaneous calcitonin, and intravenous glucocorticoids, followed by intravenous bisphosphonates. Due to his persistent hypercalcemia he was subsequently given 120 mg denosumab (Prolia). During hospitalization, there was significant improvement in his mental status concurrently with the normalization of his calcium level, which was 9.44 mg/dl at discharge.
His past history was remarkable for his 2016 diagnosis of Rai stage IV chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The fluorescence in situ hybridization reaction revealed the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del (17p)) in 20% of B-cell lymphocytes. In addition, in a bone marrow biopsy, the patient was found to have unmutated IGHV gene status and ZAP 70 expression in leukemia cells.
In 09/2017 he was admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine because of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Treatment with a high dose glucocorticoid was started, followed by a slow tapering down of the dose. In 12/2017 he was again admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine with left hemiparesis, dysarthria, and left facial nerve palsy. Complete right carotid occlusion was found in the CT angiography.
After discharge, he was treated with 2 courses of a Rituximab + Bendamustine protocol with a significant decrease in lymphocytes counts. In September 2018 treatment with the second line agent Ibrutinib was started. One month later, he developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm. Six days before the present admission, the patient was hospitalized because of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with no evidence of myocardial ischemia. Ibrutinib was stopped because it was presumed to be the cause of the arrhythmia. During his present hospitalization additional laboratory tests revealed an elevated LDH level of 2250 U/l (reference range: 230–480), an alkaline phosphatase level of 220 U/l (reference range: 30–120), and low levels of PTH: 4.8 pg/ml (reference range: 18.4–81), 25 hydroxyvitamin D level of 52 mmol/l (reference range: 75–220) with normal 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D level of 61.3 nmol/l (reference range: 50–190), WBC 108.000 (reference range: 4.5–11.5 K/μl), Lymphocytes 57%, PLT count of 88.000 (reference range: 150–450 K/μl).
In the setting of his elevated LDH level, further decrease in his PLT level to 45.000 and severe hypercalcemia, it was decided to perform a positron emission tomography/computed tomography to assess the possibility of Richter transformation. The scan revealed a 1.3 cm nodule with an intensive uptake of tracer in the upper left lobe of the lung and in vertebra D 7, suspicious of metastasis (Fig. ).
He underwent a bronchoscopy with a transbronchial biopsy of the lesion. Non-small cell carcinoma displaying positive CK 7 and negative to TTF-1, napsin-A, and p 40 immunostaining was diagnosed. An epidermal growth factor genotype was negative for mutations. Immunohistochemical analysis was negative for ALK and ROS1 protein rearrangement as well as PDL1 expression. He underwent 1 course of chemotherapy in September 2019 that included carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembroluzumab. Results of the molecular analysis of the tumor were negative for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genotype mutations, ALK and ROS 1 rearrangement, and PDL-1 protein expression. He then began treatment with venetoclax for his refractory CLL.
Ten days after starting therapy with venetoclax, he was admitted to the internal medicine department with large left upper lobe pneumonia. A chest CT revealed a large infiltrate with an air bronchogram. A subsequent urine antigen test was positive for legionella pneumonia. He completed treatment with respiratory quinolone for 21 days and was returned to oncological and hematological supervision.
The patient received a second course of chemotherapy, but 4 days later he was admitted with suspected pneumonia and despite the broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, respiratory failure developed and he passed away.

Here is the task:
Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with abdominal pain, lack of appetite, nausea, weight loss, and fatigue. The patient had lost nearly 12 kilograms in the past 6 months. Abdominal pain was localized in the right upper quadrant. She had obtuse pain that had no relation to food. It was found that the patient had osteoporosis in her history but did not receive any treatment. In the physical examination of the patient, who did not present any characteristics in her family history, the liver extended to 2 cm below the costal margin. She did not have ascites or splenomegaly. Heart and lung examinations were normal. Laboratory tests presented a normal hemogram. Biochemical tests revealed an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 50 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 20 U/L, total bilirubin level of 1.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 101 U/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase level of 227 U/L, albumin level of 2.6 g/dL, total protein level of 4.9 g/dL, calcium level of 12,35 mg/dL, and a phosphate level of 2.6 mg/dL. The patient was hospitalized in order to investigate the etiology of hypercalcemia. The patient had a parathormone level of 9.5 pg/mL. These results excluded a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient who was thought to have malignant hypercalcemia was started on intravenous fluid replacement and furosemide treatment. The patient who manifested a creatinine clearance of 55.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 was started on 2 mg zoledronic acid treatment. Tomography scans demonstrated no osteolytic bone lesions. During follow-up, the patient's calcium levels regressed to 9.7 mg/dL with the specified treatment. Abdominal ultrasonography performed due to right upper quadrant pain and hepatomegaly revealed multiple hypoechoic images in the liver, of which the largest was 1.5 cm in size, and a coarsely granular parenchyma. The dynamic CT of the patient demonstrated hypodense lesions with multiple areas of peripheral contrast enhancement that were particularly congregated in the right lobe, the largest of which had a size of 47 × 32 mm, and this was interpreted as metastasis (Figure ).
Levels of alpha-fetoprotein were determined as 91 ng/mL, cancer antigen (CA-125) as 258.6 U/mL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as 0.82 ng/mL, and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) as 2.1 U/mL. A biopsy was performed on the mass in the liver for diagnosis. Pathology result indicated cholangiocellular cancer (Figure ). The patient did not consent to surgical resection; therefore, a monthly zoledronic acid treatment was planned for pain palpation and hypercalcemia.

Here is the task:
Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.

The patient had lost nearly 12 kilograms in the past 6 months. Abdominal pain was localized in the right upper quadrant. She had obtuse pain that had no relation to food. It was found that the patient had osteoporosis in her history but did not receive any treatment. In the physical examination of the patient, who did not present any characteristics in her family history, the liver extended to 2 cm below the costal margin. She did not have ascites or splenomegaly. Heart and lung examinations were normal. Laboratory tests presented a normal hemogram. Biochemical tests revealed an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 50 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 20 U/L, total bilirubin level of 1.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 101 U/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase level of 227 U/L, albumin level of 2.6 g/dL, total protein level of 4.9 g/dL, calcium level of 12,35 mg/dL, and a phosphate level of 2.6 mg/dL. The patient was hospitalized in order to investigate the etiology of hypercalcemia. The patient had a parathormone level of 9.5 pg/mL. These results excluded a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient who was thought to have malignant hypercalcemia was started on intravenous fluid replacement and furosemide treatment. The patient who manifested a creatinine clearance of 55.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 was started on 2 mg zoledronic acid treatment. Tomography scans demonstrated no osteolytic bone lesions. During follow-up, the patient's calcium levels regressed to 9.7 mg/dL with the specified treatment. Abdominal ultrasonography performed due to right upper quadrant pain and hepatomegaly revealed multiple hypoechoic images in the liver, of which the largest was 1.5 cm in size, and a coarsely granular parenchyma. The dynamic CT of the patient demonstrated hypodense lesions with multiple areas of peripheral contrast enhancement that were particularly congregated in the right lobe, the largest of which had a size of 47 × 32 mm, and this was interpreted as metastasis (Figure ).\nLevels of alpha-fetoprotein were determined as 91 ng/mL, cancer antigen (CA-125) as 258.6 U/mL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as 0.82 ng/mL, and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) as 2.1 U/mL.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-yr-old female patient with body weight of 45 kg, having type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, post-lumbar spine fixation (L2-L4) was posted for right-sided total hip replacement. She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years ago for ischaemic heart disease. Blood investigation showed haemoglobin 9.2 gm/dl, normal blood count, renal function and serum electrolytes. Serum calcium was 8.3 mg/dl and serum albumin was 3.2 mg/dl. Glycosylated haemoglobin was 6.0, revealing adequate blood glucose control. Electrocardiogram showed evidence of old inferior wall myocardial infarction. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function with mild hypertrophy. She was on tablet aspirin 75 mg once daily (OD) orally for antithrombotic prophylaxis.
In view of her cardiac history, adequate perioperative analgesia was needed along with general anaesthesia. Thus, right sided continuous erector spinae block along was planned in combination with general anaesthesia.
Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was administered with injection cefuroxime 1.5 g intravenous (IV). Under ultrasound guidance, a continuous erector spinae block was performed at L3 level. After explaining the procedure, consent was taken from the patient. She was placed in left lateral position for right sided block since we found it ergonomically easy to hold the ultrasound probe (high frequency linear probe) with left hand and place it transversely. An 18-guage tuohy needle was approached in-plane lateral to medial. When the needle initially touched the transverse process of L3 vertebrae, the needle was gently withdrawn and hydrodissection of the plane was achieved, lifting the erector spinae muscle. A 20-guage catheter was introduced through the needle and total length inserted was 3 cm more than the tip of needle. The catheter was secured properly for perioperative use. The patient was hydrated with 10 ml/kg of ringer lactate before induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with injection fentanyl 75 mcg iv and injection propofol 100 mg iv and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) size 3 was inserted. Anaesthesia was maintained with FiO20.5 (nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture) and sevoflurane. A bolus dose of 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine was given through the catheter placed in erector spinae plane. The procedure was uneventful with no haemodynamic disturbances and minimal blood loss. After surgery, inhalational anaesthetics were stopped, and LMA was removed. Patient had an uneventful recovery. Post-operatively, the patient was comfortable with infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine at 6 ml/h as continuous erector spinae block. She did not require any rescue analgesics. She was discharged on the fifth post-operative day after removing the catheter.

 Here is the patient note:
A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

Here is the task:
Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.

Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus. Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome. Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases. It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

7.84
To calculate the corrected calcium level, we need to use the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula. The formula is: Corrected Calcium = Measured Calcium + (0.8 x (4 - Albumin)). In this case, the measured calcium level is 7.2 mg/dL, and the albumin level is 3.2 g/dL. We will set the normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL. First, we will calculate the difference between the normal albumin and the patient's albumin level: 4 - 3.2 = 0.8. Then, we will multiply this difference by 0.8: 0.8 x 0.8 = 0.64. Finally, we will add this value to the measured calcium level: 7.2 + 0.64 = 7.84.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Taiwanese man was admitted to our medical oncology ward with the chief complaint of progressive exertional dyspnea for twenty days in December 2017. He had been diagnosed with bony metastasis from prostate cancer for 8 years and failed various kinds of treatment including luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (leuprorelin), androgen receptor antagonist (bicalutamide), denosumab and docetaxel. He was brought to our hospital after starting on dexamethasone and abiraterone acetate without improvement of serum prostate specific antigen level for two months in a medical center nearby.
There was no obvious bone pain, chills or fever. He denied other major systemic disease except essential hypertension under regular medical control. His chest X-ray film disclosed right side costophrenic angle blunting and a little fluid accumulation in the minor fissure without extensive pulmonary edema. Blood chemistry showed that levels of alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within normal ranges. Abnormal results included alkaline phosphatase of 123 iu/L (normal 32 to 91), albumin of 3.2 g/dL (normal 3.5 to 4.8) and calcium of 7.7 mg/dL (normal 8.6 to 10). Serum prostate specific antigen level was 905 ng/mL (normal 0 to 4). Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (41.2 sec, control 31.5) and prothrombin time (international normalized ratio 1.23) were noted. Although plasma fibrinogen level was still normal (335 mg/dL, normal 200 to 400), the concentration of D-dimer was extremely high (over 20,000 ng/mL, normal less than 500). Blood routine test revealed hemoglobin of 6.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 89.4 fl, platelet count of 1,1000/μL, and white cell count of 7,200/μL with extraordinary abnormal differential counts: segments 19%, lymphocytes 35%, monocytes 1%, eosinophils 3%, bands 19%, metamyelocytes 11%, myelocytes 6%, promyelocytes 4%, blasts 1%, and atypical lymphocytes 1%. There were 48 nucleated red cells per 100 white cells. A diagnosis of leukoerythroblastosis was thus established based on morphological evidence ().
Bone marrow aspiration from right side posterior superior iliac crest gave a smear of full-blown metastatic carcinoma with many clustered, dispersed or microacinar groups of epithelioid malignant cells. Bone marrow biopsy from the same area showed a picture of metastatic adenocarcinoma composed of highly pleomorphic tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and vacuolated cytoplasm, infiltrating diffusely in the marrow with a sheeted pattern. The carcinoma cells were positive for prostate specific membrane antigen, negative for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20 on immunohistochemical stains using Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (Leica Biosystem, Milton Keynes, UK) performed on automated Leica Bond MAX stainer (Leica Biosystem, Melbourne, Australia) with three primary antibodies (Leica Biosystem) ().
There were only a few small metastatic lesions over skull, manubrium, and ribs in bone scan performed two months earlier but diffuse bone marrow involvement and destruction could be seen in magnetic resonance imaging of spine done one month prior to the present hospitalization (). The patient decided to receive palliative treatment upon knowing his incurable disease status and died of multiple organ failure resulting from fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation two weeks later.

He had been diagnosed with bony metastasis from prostate cancer for 8 years and failed various kinds of treatment including luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (leuprorelin), androgen receptor antagonist (bicalutamide), denosumab and docetaxel. He was brought to our hospital after starting on dexamethasone and abiraterone acetate without improvement of serum prostate specific antigen level for two months in a medical center nearby.\nThere was no obvious bone pain, chills or fever. He denied other major systemic disease except essential hypertension under regular medical control. His chest X-ray film disclosed right side costophrenic angle blunting and a little fluid accumulation in the minor fissure without extensive pulmonary edema. Blood chemistry showed that levels of alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within normal ranges. Abnormal results included alkaline phosphatase of 123 iu/L (normal 32 to 91), albumin of 3.2 g/dL (normal 3.5 to 4.8) and calcium of 7.7 mg/dL (normal 8.6 to 10). Serum prostate specific antigen level was 905 ng/mL (normal 0 to 4). Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (41.2 sec, control 31.5) and prothrombin time (international normalized ratio 1.23) were noted. Although plasma fibrinogen level was still normal (335 mg/dL, normal 200 to 400), the concentration of D-dimer was extremely high (over 20,000 ng/mL, normal less than 500). Blood routine test revealed hemoglobin of 6.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 89.4 fl, platelet count of 1,1000/μL, and white cell count of 7,200/μL with extraordinary abnormal differential counts: segments 19%, lymphocytes 35%, monocytes 1%, eosinophils 3%, bands 19%, metamyelocytes 11%, myelocytes 6%, promyelocytes 4%, blasts 1%, and atypical lymphocytes 1%. There were 48 nucleated red cells per 100 white cells. A diagnosis of leukoerythroblastosis was thus established based on morphological evidence ().\nBone marrow aspiration from right side posterior superior iliac crest gave a smear of full-blown metastatic carcinoma with many clustered, dispersed or microacinar groups of epithelioid malignant cells. Bone marrow biopsy from the same area showed a picture of metastatic adenocarcinoma composed of highly pleomorphic tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and vacuolated cytoplasm, infiltrating diffusely in the marrow with a sheeted pattern. The carcinoma cells were positive for prostate specific membrane antigen, negative for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20 on immunohistochemical stains using Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (Leica Biosystem, Milton Keynes, UK) performed on automated Leica Bond MAX stainer (Leica Biosystem, Melbourne, Australia) with three primary antibodies (Leica Biosystem) ().\nThere were only a few small metastatic lesions over skull, manubrium, and ribs in bone scan performed two months earlier but diffuse bone marrow involvement and destruction could be seen in magnetic resonance imaging of spine done one month prior to the present hospitalization ().

 Here is the patient note:
A 4050-gram male newborn was delivered vaginally to a 20-year-old mother at 413/7 gestational weeks with no dysmorphic features and discharged on the postnatal day two. On the postnatal day six, a distended abdomen was noticed and baby was admitted to another hospital for investigations. On abdominal examination firm mass was palpable. The liver was occupying the entire abdomen. The patient also had edema of the lower extremities and mild respiratory distress.
Initial laboratory findings including complete blood count (hemoglobin: 14.6 g/dl, white blood count: 22,800 /l, platelet count: 330,000/l), electrolytes and renal function tests were within normal range. Alanine aminotransferase level (19 U/l, N: <45 U/l) was normal. However aspartate aminotransferase (85 U/l, N: <41 U/l), gamma glutamyl transferase (238 U/l, N: 8-61 U/l) and total/direct bilirubin levels (3/1.6 mg/dl, N: <1.1/<0.3 mg/dl) were high. Serological evaluation for toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Epstein–Barr virus and parvovirus were all negative. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) revealed hepatomegaly with a heterogeneous liver parenchyma and a 39x31 mm hypo-echoic solitary non-calcified mass in the right adrenal region. A computed tomography scan revealed a right adrenal soft tissue mass (4.8x3.6 cm) with no calcification and contrast uptake, and significant hepatomegaly. The spleen appeared to be in normal size but was replaced inferiorly because of the massive hepatomegaly. Serum neuron-specific enolase level was higher, 60 ng/mL (normal range: <10 ng/mL), and alpha feto protein level (22754 ng/mL, N: >45000 ng/mL at birth) was normal. Urine vanillylmandelic acid and serum ferritin levels were 5718 mg/day (N: 0.5-2 mg/day) and 531 ng/mL (N: 24-336 ng/mL) retrospectively. Bone marrow aspiration revealed no malignant infiltration, no rosette forming and no storage cells. On the postnatal day eighteen, doppler USG showed decreased flow in the IVC, secondary to compression. Based on clinical presentation and imaging modalities, the presumptive diagnosis of NBL was made and the case was referred to our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on the postnatal day twenty.
On admission to our NICU, he had respiratory distress with 40% O2 requirement and significant abdominal distension with visible thin venous vessels through his abdominal skin (Fig. 1a). He had tachypnea besides edema of lower extremities, scrotum and penile area. Complete blood count revealed anemia (hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dl), leukocytosis (33.300 /l) and mild thrombocytosis (536.000/l). Serum sodium (128 mEq/l), chloride (94 mEq/l), calcium (7 mg/dl) and phosphorus (0.7 mg/dl) concentrations were low. Serum uric acid and renal function tests revealed normal results (uric acid: 5.8 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen: 9 mg/dl, creatinine: 0.43 mg/dl). Liver function tests revealed cholestasis (alanine aminotransferase: 40 U/l, aspartate aminotransferase: 101 U/l, γ-glutamyltransferase: 463 U/l, total/direct bilirubin: 3.05/2.02 mg/dl) and hypoproteinemia (total protein: 3.4 g/dl and albumin: 1.8 g/dl). Clotting studies demonstrated prolonged prothrombin time (PT) as 16 seconds (N: 9.4 to 12.5 seconds) and low fibrinogen level (0.89 g/dl, N: 2.38–4.98).
Second abdominal USG evaluation showed right suprarenal mass which was about 5 cm in diameter, severely diffuse hepatomegaly and ascites. After pediatric oncology consultation, the patient underwent hydration, chemotherapy and allopurinol treatments between the postnatal days 20–23. The patient received modified VEC (vincristine, etoposide, carboplatin) protocol due to poor clinical condition. In spite of the received chemotherapy, his clinical condition worsened progressively. The abdominal distention was so increased that he required high frequency oscillatory ventilation support. However, he did not develop signs of tumor lysis syndrome. The patient was accepted as chemotherapy-resistant NBL due to clinical deterioration with massive liver involvement on the 3rd day of treatment and surgical excision was performed (Fig. 1b, 1c). Pathology revealed intra-adrenal tumor with wide-spread expression of bcl 2 in addition to distant metastases in the liver and minimal lymphocytic infiltration. MYC-N amplification obtained from adrenal specimen revealed <3 copies. IVC compression directly observed during the surgery resulted in severe circulation collapse and the patient died due to hypotensive shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation just two hours after the operation.

8.76
First, we need to identify the patient's albumin level, which is 1.8 g/dL. Then, we need to calculate the corrected calcium level using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula: Corrected Calcium = Measured Calcium + (4 - Albumin) x 0.8. In this case, the measured calcium is 7 mg/dL, and the albumin is 1.8 g/dL. Plugging in the values, we get: Corrected Calcium = 7 + (4 - 1.8) x 0.8 = 7 + 2.2 x 0.8 = 7 + 1.76 = 8.76 mg/dL.
{'Row Number': 111, 'Calculator Name': 'Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia', 'Calculator ID': '7', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-3754395-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 4050-gram male newborn was delivered vaginally to a 20-year-old mother at 413/7 gestational weeks with no dysmorphic features and discharged on the postnatal day two. On the postnatal day six, a distended abdomen was noticed and baby was admitted to another hospital for investigations. On abdominal examination firm mass was palpable. The liver was occupying the entire abdomen. The patient also had edema of the lower extremities and mild respiratory distress.\nInitial laboratory findings including complete blood count (hemoglobin: 14.6 g/dl, white blood count: 22,800 /l, platelet count: 330,000/l), electrolytes and renal function tests were within normal range. Alanine aminotransferase level (19 U/l, N: <45 U/l) was normal. However aspartate aminotransferase (85 U/l, N: <41 U/l), gamma glutamyl transferase (238 U/l, N: 8-61 U/l) and total/direct bilirubin levels (3/1.6 mg/dl, N: <1.1/<0.3 mg/dl) were high. Serological evaluation for toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Epstein–Barr virus and parvovirus were all negative. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) revealed hepatomegaly with a heterogeneous liver parenchyma and a 39x31 mm hypo-echoic solitary non-calcified mass in the right adrenal region. A computed tomography scan revealed a right adrenal soft tissue mass (4.8x3.6 cm) with no calcification and contrast uptake, and significant hepatomegaly. The spleen appeared to be in normal size but was replaced inferiorly because of the massive hepatomegaly. Serum neuron-specific enolase level was higher, 60 ng/mL (normal range: <10 ng/mL), and alpha feto protein level (22754 ng/mL, N: >45000 ng/mL at birth) was normal. Urine vanillylmandelic acid and serum ferritin levels were 5718 mg/day (N: 0.5-2 mg/day) and 531 ng/mL (N: 24-336 ng/mL) retrospectively. Bone marrow aspiration revealed no malignant infiltration, no rosette forming and no storage cells. On the postnatal day eighteen, doppler USG showed decreased flow in the IVC, secondary to compression. Based on clinical presentation and imaging modalities, the presumptive diagnosis of NBL was made and the case was referred to our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on the postnatal day twenty.\nOn admission to our NICU, he had respiratory distress with 40% O2 requirement and significant abdominal distension with visible thin venous vessels through his abdominal skin (Fig. 1a). He had tachypnea besides edema of lower extremities, scrotum and penile area. Complete blood count revealed anemia (hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dl), leukocytosis (33.300 /l) and mild thrombocytosis (536.000/l). Serum sodium (128 mEq/l), chloride (94 mEq/l), calcium (7 mg/dl) and phosphorus (0.7 mg/dl) concentrations were low. Serum uric acid and renal function tests revealed normal results (uric acid: 5.8 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen: 9 mg/dl, creatinine: 0.43 mg/dl). Liver function tests revealed cholestasis (alanine aminotransferase: 40 U/l, aspartate aminotransferase: 101 U/l, γ-glutamyltransferase: 463 U/l, total/direct bilirubin: 3.05/2.02 mg/dl) and hypoproteinemia (total protein: 3.4 g/dl and albumin: 1.8 g/dl). Clotting studies demonstrated prolonged prothrombin time (PT) as 16 seconds (N: 9.4 to 12.5 seconds) and low fibrinogen level (0.89 g/dl, N: 2.38–4.98).\nSecond abdominal USG evaluation showed right suprarenal mass which was about 5 cm in diameter, severely diffuse hepatomegaly and ascites. After pediatric oncology consultation, the patient underwent hydration, chemotherapy and allopurinol treatments between the postnatal days 20–23. The patient received modified VEC (vincristine, etoposide, carboplatin) protocol due to poor clinical condition. In spite of the received chemotherapy, his clinical condition worsened progressively. The abdominal distention was so increased that he required high frequency oscillatory ventilation support. However, he did not develop signs of tumor lysis syndrome. The patient was accepted as chemotherapy-resistant NBL due to clinical deterioration with massive liver involvement on the 3rd day of treatment and surgical excision was performed (Fig. 1b, 1c). Pathology revealed intra-adrenal tumor with wide-spread expression of bcl 2 in addition to distant metastases in the liver and minimal lymphocytic infiltration. MYC-N amplification obtained from adrenal specimen revealed <3 copies. IVC compression directly observed during the surgery resulted in severe circulation collapse and the patient died due to hypotensive shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation just two hours after the operation.', 'Question': "Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

 Here is the patient note:
A 12-year-old boy had to undergo operative procedure for epispadias and was on surgical prophylaxis with netilmicin 150 mg i.v. twice daily and ceftriaxone (500 mg) i.v twice daily. The boy received both the drugs for 3 days (six doses) following which he developed severe spasm of the feet and hands [Figures –]. On observation the patient was irritable, there was flexion of the hands at the wrists and of the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints and extension of the fingers at the inter-phalangeal joints; the feet were dorsiflexed at the ankles and the toes plantar flexed. Immediate laboratory investigation revealed the following picture: Serum calcium 7.2 mg/dL (normal, 8.7-11 mg/dL), potassium 3.9 mmol/L (normal, 3.5-5.5 mmol/L), and sodium of 145 mmol/L (normal, 135-155 mmol/L), serum creatinine 3.0 mg/dL and serum albumin 3.4 g/dL (normal, 3.8-4.4 g/dL) with normal urine output. Total bilirubin, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) were also normal. Assuming that the patient developed drug-induced nonoliguric renal failure; both the drugs were withdrawn and the surgery postponed. The hypocalcemia was managed with i.v calcium gluconate. 24 h following this episode the laboratory investigations were repeated, which showed serum calcium 9.3 mg/dL, potassium, 3.9 mmol/L, sodium 144 mmol/L and serum albumin 4.2 g/dL []. On recovery, the patient was discharged with oral calcium supplementation. After 4 weeks the surgery was planned. Netilmicin 300 mg once daily was given preoperatively for 1 day and continued postoperatively. But after 3 days (4 doses) postoperatively the patient developed the same features of carpopedal spasm with laboratory findings of hypocalcemia. On withdrawal of netilmicin and calcium supplementation the boy recovered.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old female presented with nontraumatic, chronic dull-aching low back pain with worsening symptoms for the previous one year. The pain affected her walking such that she was “waddling” to avoid the pain. On occasions the pain would radiate to the right leg as well as anterior and lateral thigh but not past the knee. There were no associated paresthesias or significant weakness. She denied history of cancer, weight loss, fever, chills, or night sweats. There was no history of nephrolithiasis or bone fractures. She was being treated for diabetes and hypertension. She had history of pulmonary emboli of unclear etiology in the 1990 s. Surgical history included cholecystectomy in 1994, uterine endometrial ablation in 1996, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgeries. She had an allergy to penicillin causing a rash and an intolerance to sulfa causing abdominal discomfort. The patient reported remote history of smoking for 15 years, quitting 25 years ago. Family history was negative for bone disease. Physical exam was remarkable for her being overweight. She had a side-to-side waddle in her gait and slightly lifted her feet on walking. Straight leg raising test was negative. She did not have tenderness to percussion of the lower back but did have a gibbous at L-4. There was no back pain with movement. She had weakness at the iliopsoas and quadriceps bilaterally but no loss of sensation. An outside MRI of the lumbar spine showed an infiltrative lesion in the L-4 vertebra with collapse of the body (confirmed on repeat MRI at our institution, ). CT scan confirmed a pathologic fracture of L-4 with a lytic lesion. A bone scan showed mildly increased radiotracer uptake at L-4, and additional uptake was seen in several lower thoracic ribs bilaterally, as well as the xiphoid process, upper right femur, and skull, suggesting metabolic bone disease. The L-4 lesion was hypermetabolic on PET scan (). Initial CT guided biopsy of the lesion was nondiagnostic demonstrating only bone, fibrous tissue, and cartilage. Laboratory testing was remarkable for low serum phosphorus of 1.5 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL). Additional abnormalities included elevated serum calcium of 10.6 mg/dL (8.9–10.1 mg/dL), inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (PTH) of 120 pg/mL (15–65 pg/mL), low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D of <8 pg/mL (18–78 pg/mL), and mildly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase of 162 u/L (45–115 u/L). Serum albumin was normal at 4.0 g/dL (3.5–5.0 g/dL), serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1 mg/dL), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D was normal at 31 ng/mL (25–80 ng/mL). She had frank phosphaturia, especially for her level of serum phosphorus (772 mg, normal 0–1,099 mg). 24-hour urine calcium was low at 10 mg (20–275 mg). Serum and urinary protein electrophoresis with immunofixation were normal. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was normal at 2.12 mIU/L (0.3–5.0 mIU/L). Parathyroid scan was normal. Plasma FGF-23 from a peripheral vein was significantly elevated at 3,500 RU/mL (<180 RU/mL), confirming TIO. Oral phosphate supplementation and calcitriol were prescribed. She was subsequently lost to followup from our medical center for two years, and when she returned, she reported that she had internal fixation with a rod placement for a spontaneous right femur fracture. She also had deep pain in her left thigh and was told by a local provider that she had a “brown tumor” in the left femur based on plain radiographs. She had not been taking phosphate supplements or calcitriol on a regular basis. Repeat laboratory investigations continued to show a significantly low phosphorus of 1.4 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL), high serum calcium of 10.6 mg/dL (8.9–10.1 mg/dL), elevated PTH of 229.1 pg/mL (10–65 pg/mL), and serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (0.6–1.1 mg/dL). Plasma FGF-23 level remained significantly elevated at 4,460 RU/mL (<180 RU/mL). A repeat CT guided needle biopsy of L-4 showed a low grade spindle cell neoplasm with positive FGF-23 mRNA expression by RT-PCR (), confirming the diagnosis of mixed phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor (PMT). She suffered a spontaneous left peritrochanteric fracture requiring placement of an intramedullary device. The patient then elected to have surgery involving anterior resection of the L-4 vertebral body to complete total spondylectomy at this spinal level, along with corpectomy. Pathology of the resection specimen confirmed a spindle cell neoplasm consistent with PMTMCT. Six months after surgical resection, she was independent in activities of daily living but was using a walker for ambulation due to some difficulty walking and right foot drop. She was prescribed physical therapy. Follow-up laboratory testing revealed normal serum phosphorus at 2.5 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL) and calcium of 9.6 mg/dL (8.9–10.1 mg/dL). PTH was 619 pg/mL (10–65 pg/mL). This is on minimal phosphate supplementation without calcitriol. Repeat plasma FGF-23 level remained elevated but had greatly decreased to 422 RU/mL (<180 RU/mL).

The pain affected her walking such that she was “waddling” to avoid the pain. On occasions the pain would radiate to the right leg as well as anterior and lateral thigh but not past the knee. There were no associated paresthesias or significant weakness. She denied history of cancer, weight loss, fever, chills, or night sweats. There was no history of nephrolithiasis or bone fractures. She was being treated for diabetes and hypertension. She had history of pulmonary emboli of unclear etiology in the 1990 s. Surgical history included cholecystectomy in 1994, uterine endometrial ablation in 1996, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgeries. She had an allergy to penicillin causing a rash and an intolerance to sulfa causing abdominal discomfort. The patient reported remote history of smoking for 15 years, quitting 25 years ago. Family history was negative for bone disease. Physical exam was remarkable for her being overweight. She had a side-to-side waddle in her gait and slightly lifted her feet on walking. Straight leg raising test was negative. She did not have tenderness to percussion of the lower back but did have a gibbous at L-4. There was no back pain with movement. She had weakness at the iliopsoas and quadriceps bilaterally but no loss of sensation. An outside MRI of the lumbar spine showed an infiltrative lesion in the L-4 vertebra with collapse of the body (confirmed on repeat MRI at our institution, ). CT scan confirmed a pathologic fracture of L-4 with a lytic lesion. A bone scan showed mildly increased radiotracer uptake at L-4, and additional uptake was seen in several lower thoracic ribs bilaterally, as well as the xiphoid process, upper right femur, and skull, suggesting metabolic bone disease. The L-4 lesion was hypermetabolic on PET scan (). Initial CT guided biopsy of the lesion was nondiagnostic demonstrating only bone, fibrous tissue, and cartilage. Laboratory testing was remarkable for low serum phosphorus of 1.5 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL). Additional abnormalities included elevated serum calcium of 10.6 mg/dL (8.9–10.1 mg/dL), inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (PTH) of 120 pg/mL (15–65 pg/mL), low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D of <8 pg/mL (18–78 pg/mL), and mildly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase of 162 u/L (45–115 u/L). Serum albumin was normal at 4.0 g/dL (3.5–5.0 g/dL), serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1 mg/dL), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D was normal at 31 ng/mL (25–80 ng/mL). She had frank phosphaturia, especially for her level of serum phosphorus (772 mg, normal 0–1,099 mg). 24-hour urine calcium was low at 10 mg (20–275 mg). Serum and urinary protein electrophoresis with immunofixation were normal. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was normal at 2.12 mIU/L (0.3–5.0 mIU/L). Parathyroid scan was normal. Plasma FGF-23 from a peripheral vein was significantly elevated at 3,500 RU/mL (<180 RU/mL), confirming TIO. Oral phosphate supplementation and calcitriol were prescribed. She was subsequently lost to followup from our medical center for two years, and when she returned, she reported that she had internal fixation with a rod placement for a spontaneous right femur fracture. She also had deep pain in her left thigh and was told by a local provider that she had a “brown tumor” in the left femur based on plain radiographs. She had not been taking phosphate supplements or calcitriol on a regular basis. Repeat laboratory investigations continued to show a significantly low phosphorus of 1.4 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL), high serum calcium of 10.6 mg/dL (8.9–10.1 mg/dL), elevated PTH of 229.1 pg/mL (10–65 pg/mL), and serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (0.6–1.1 mg/dL).

 Here is the patient note:
A 10-year-old Sudanese boy presented with frequent episodes of vomiting associated with epigastric pain and weight loss for 6 months. He had no respiratory, neurological, rheumatological, ophthalmologic, or dermatological symptoms. Physical examination showed a pale child with weight and height both below the 3rd percentile for age. Laboratory investigations were remarkable for anemia (hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), ESR 114 mm/h, serum calcium 2.26 mmol/L, and low albumin level 28 g/L. Endoscopy revealed an erosive, friable, and nodular gastric mucosa over the entire stomach. Histopathology of biopsies revealed chronic noncaseating granulomatous inflammation []. Special stains and cultures for acid-fast and fungal microorganisms showed negative results. Colonoscopy was normal including terminal ileum. CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated multiple, small, centrolobularly distributed nodules within the acini of both lungs and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Ophthalmological examination showed evidence of uveitis. ACE level was elevated at 135 U/L. Similar to Case 1, extensive investigations for infectious, immunologic, and inflammatory conditions associated with GIT granulomatous inflammation were negative.
The combination of tissue findings of granulomatous disease from upper GIT, elevated ACE, systemic involvement, and negative workup for infectious disease suggested systemic sarcoidosis with significant GI involvement. The patient received corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg/day and omeprazole, resulting in resolution of GI symptoms and normalization of activity markers and ACE level. Tapering of corticosteroids over 3 months led to relapse of the disease. Again, remission was induced by a course of steroids supplemented by mesalamine (Pentasa 50 mg/kg/day) and azathioprine (up to 2.5 mg/kg/day) to maintain remission. Throughout the 4-year follow up, the course of the disease was punctuated by several relapses on tapering of corticosteroids and later development of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia: hemoglobin 10.6 gm/dL, macrocytosis (MCV 102, normal 80–91 fL), hyperchromasia (MCH 34.5, normal 20–31 pg), low serum vitamin B12 119.2 pmol/L (normal 162–638 pmol/L). Red blood cell folate level was normal at 16.2 nmol/L (normal, 10.4–42.2 nmol/L). Antigastric parietal cell antibodies were negative. The patient received weekly injections of vitamin B12 ( 1 mg weekly) for 6 weeks that raised the level to 231.8 pmol/L with correction of anemia and normalization of his peripheral blood picture.
Considering the steroid dependency of the disease and the short stature of the patient, he was commenced on infliximab 5 mg/kg administered intravenously at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and then every 8 weeks. The patient reported a significant subjective general improvement as well as resolution of his GI symptoms. ESR and ACE concentration returned to normal. A repeat of endoscopy after the 6th dose of infliximab infusion demonstrated loss of gastric folds pattern and loss of normal vascular pattern; otherwise there were no more erosions or friability. Biopsies from the gastric mucosa showed a marked reduction of inflammation, atrophic gastric glands, and absence of granulomas. At 5 years posttreatment with infliximab, the patient remains in remission off corticosteroids.

Since the normal albumin concentration is 4 g/dL, we need to calculate the corrected calcium level using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula: Corrected Calcium (mg/dL) = Measured Calcium (mmol/L) x (4 g/dL / Albumin level (g/L)). The measured calcium level is 2.26 mmol/L. Plugging in the values, we get: Corrected Calcium (mg/dL) = 2.26 mmol/L x (4 g/dL / 28 g/L) = 0.32 mmol/L x 0.143 = 0.46 mg/dL.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '8.96', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the patient's correct calcium level in mg/dL, the formula is  (0.8 * (Normal Albumin (in g/dL) - Patient's Albumin (in g/dL))) + Serum Calcium (in mg/dL).\nThe patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL.\nThe concentration of Albmumin is 28.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 28.0 g Albmumin/10.0 dL = 2.8 g Albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 28.0 g Albmumin/L converts to 2.8 g Albmumin/dL. \nThe concentration of Calcium is 2.26 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of Calcium is 2.26 mmol. To convert 2.26 mmol of Calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.26 mmol Calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.002 mol Calcium. To convert from mol Calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.002 mol Calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.08 g Calcium. To convert 0.08 g of Calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.08 g Calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 80.0 mg Calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old man was admitted to our internal medicine department for recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycemia. Type 2 DM was diagnosed when he was 31 years old and initially treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents. The patient discontinued oral antidiabetic agents and started insulin therapy 4 years before admission. At that time, he was treated with long-acting insulin glargine and insulin aspart. This insulin regimen was switched to insulin degludec/liraglutide 3 months before admission. While he was on insulin degludec/liraglutide, his home blood glucose monitoring ranged from 110 to 70 mg/dL. Five days before admission, while on insulin degludec/liraglutide in a dose of 18 IU daily, the patient started having recurrent episodes of diaphoresis. During those episodes, usually in the early morning before breakfast, his blood glucose levels were below 50 mg/dL. The patient suffered from several further episodes despite insulin dosage tapering and even after discontinuation. His past medical history was notable for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, acute coronary syndrome, and osteomyelitis of the left foot. His family medical history included atrial fibrillation and DM. In addition to insulin, his therapy consisted in acetylsalicylic acid, bisoprolol, furosemide, ramipril, and atorvastatin. He denied oral antihyperglycemic agents. He had no known drug allergies, he was a former smoker, and he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.
On admission, the patient's blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate was 71 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 98%, while he was breathing ambient air. The patient's body mass index was 26.7 kg/m2 (height: 173 cm; weight: 80 kg), and the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory data on admission showed glucose 50 mg/dl, HbA1c 50 mmol/mol, normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, hematocrit 34.8%, and mean corpuscular volume 85 fl), a normal white cell and platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 87 IU/L (normal range: 17–59), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 62 IU/l (normal range: 21–72), gamma glutamyl-transferase 545 IU/l (normal range: 15–73), alkaline phosphatase 177 IU/l (normal range: 38–126), total bilirubin 0.47 mg/dL (normal range: 0.20–1.30), lactate dehydrogenase 1021 IU/L (normal range: 313–618), albumin 3.5 g/dL (normal range: 3.6–5.5), INR 1.18, C-reactive protein 7.5 mg/dl (normal range: 0-1), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 90 mm/h (normal range: 0–15), fibrinogen 621 mg/dl (normal range: 170–410), iron 37 μg/dl (normal range: 49–181), and ferritin 776 ng/ml (normal range: 20–325). Viral markers for hepatitis B and C were negative.
Further blood tests were ordered to rule out endogenous hyperinsulinism: C-peptide was 4.2 ng/mL (normal range: 0.5–3), insulin 89 μIU/mL (normal range: 5–25), while the patient's glucose level was 40 mg/dL, and sulfonylurea screening test was negative, confirming endogenous hyperinsulinism. Markers of neuroendocrine tumors were severely increased: chromogranin A (CgA) was 1790 ng/ml (normal range: 0–100), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was 458 ng/ml (normal range: 0–11).
Given the high suspicion of insulinoma and the altered liver function tests on admission, a full-body CT scan was ordered. CT scan showed a 4.3 × 2.2 cm pancreatic tail mass containing calcifications with multiple regional lymphadenopathies (). Multiple liver secondary lesions were found: the largest ones measuring 12 and 11 cm, respectively, in II-III and IVb-V segments. No lungs, bone, and brain metastases were detected. Additionally, a thyroid nodule of 2.6 cm was incidentally found. Hepatic metastases were highly suspected to be secondary to a malignant insulinoma, so ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsies of the lesion in the II-III segments were performed (). Histological findings of four core biopsies consisted of hepatocytes infiltrated by a poorly differentiated and focally necrotic proliferating tissue of medium-sized atypical epithelial cells with solid growth pattern (). The cancer cells showed hyperchromatic nuclei with “salt and pepper” chromatin markedly Ki-67 positive, high mitotic index (10 figures × 10 HPF), and scant cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed the neuroendocrine nature and the partial insulin secreting activity of the lesion; CgA, synaptophysin, CD56, and CAM5.2 were diffusely positive; there was patchy (<5%) insulin expression. Ki-67 index was 40–50. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic, poorly differentiated (G3), neuroendocrine carcinoma with morphology and immunophenotype favoring a pancreatic primary tumor. Thyroid ultrasound () showed a weakly hypoechoic solid nodule (2.8 × 3.2 × 1.3 cm) with a central cystic component and regular margins located in the isthmus and a markedly hypoechoic solid nodule (0.9 × 0.9 × 0.6 cm) adjacent to the lower pole of the left lobe. Calcifications and intranodular flow were absent in both nodules, and regional lymph nodes were not enlarged. The results of thyroid function tests were within normal limits (TSH 0.7 mUI/L, normal range: 0.46–4.68), as well as were parathormone (PTH) (80.1 pg/mL, normal range: 13.6–85.8), calcium (8.76 mg/dL, normal range: 8.4–10.2), and phosphorus (4.32 mg/dL, normal range: 2.5–4.5). Serum calcitonin was slightly raised (30 pg/mL, normal range: 0–6), but immunohistochemical staining of the liver lesions was negative for such markers.
The patient's hospital stay was characterized by different episodes of severe hypoglycemia (as low as 18 mg/dL) occurring especially at night and in the early morning, manifesting only with diaphoresis. During those episodes, the patient never lost consciousness or developed seizures and even never complained of confusion, amnesia, weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, palpitations, or hunger. In order to reduce the hypoglycemic events, we started a symptomatic treatment with diazoxide and IV infusion of 10% dextrose, while waiting for histopathological confirmation of the disease. Unfortunately, due to the severity of this malignancy, after 8 days of treatment edema, hypotension, oliguria, and weight gain of 10 kg were observed; the patient's clinical status deteriorated rapidly, and 3 days later, the patient died from acute renal failure. Postmortem examination was not carried out according to his family's request.

Here is the task:
Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.

Type 2 DM was diagnosed when he was 31 years old and initially treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents. The patient discontinued oral antidiabetic agents and started insulin therapy 4 years before admission. At that time, he was treated with long-acting insulin glargine and insulin aspart. This insulin regimen was switched to insulin degludec/liraglutide 3 months before admission. While he was on insulin degludec/liraglutide, his home blood glucose monitoring ranged from 110 to 70 mg/dL. Five days before admission, while on insulin degludec/liraglutide in a dose of 18 IU daily, the patient started having recurrent episodes of diaphoresis. During those episodes, usually in the early morning before breakfast, his blood glucose levels were below 50 mg/dL. The patient suffered from several further episodes despite insulin dosage tapering and even after discontinuation. His past medical history was notable for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, acute coronary syndrome, and osteomyelitis of the left foot. His family medical history included atrial fibrillation and DM. In addition to insulin, his therapy consisted in acetylsalicylic acid, bisoprolol, furosemide, ramipril, and atorvastatin.

First, we need to identify the patient's albumin level from the patient note. It is mentioned that the patient's albumin level is 3.5 g/dL. Then, we need to use the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula to calculate the corrected calcium level. The formula is: Corrected Calcium = Measured Calcium + (4 - Albumin) x 0.8. We can plug in the values to get the corrected calcium level.

 Here is the patient note:
A 48-year-old Saudi male patient presented to our emergency room (ER) with a one-week history of weakness, fatigue and vomiting. His medical history was significant for the diagnosis of hepatitis C.
He denied any history of abdominal pain, hematemesis and melena or bowel problems. He gave no history of cough, expectoration, hemoptysis and dyspnea or weight loss. He had no history of alcohol drinking or cigarette smoking. He denied any history of unprotected sexual contact or drug abuse. He had a blood transfusion 18 years ago following a road traffic accident. He was started on pegylated interferon alpha therapy 20 weeks prior to his presentation as well as ribavirin treatment for his hepatitis C.
On physical examination, he was a well-developed gentleman with no cardiorespiratory distress, but looked confused. His vital signs were stable. His abdominal examination was soft, lax with no tenderness or organomegaly. His cardiorespiratory examination was normal. He had no lymphadenopathy and central nervous system examination was intact grossly with negative meningeal signs.
His blood investigations revealed normal complete blood count, renal function tests and blood glucose. He had normal lactate and lipase level. His transaminases were mildly elevated. His calcium level was 15.2 mg/dl with albumin level of 3.5 gm/dl. His parathyroid hormone level (PTH) was appropriately suppressed []. He was managed by the emergency physician with aggressive normal saline hydration, intravenous pamidronate and hydrocortisone.
Endocrinology service was consulted and impression of non-parathyroid hormone related hypercalcemia was suggested. His work-up showed bilateral hilar opacity on chest X-ray, which was confirmed by a computerized scan of the chest showing bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. His mediastinal lymph node biopsy showed non-caseating granuloma consistent with sarcoidosis.
During his hospital stay, his mental status improved and his calcium level returned to normal level within 30 days. He was managed with 0.9% normal saline hydration, and furosemide with cessation of his hepatitis C therapy []. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis with severe hypercalcemia induced by interferon therapy was made. This is based on clinical, biochemical, radiological and histopathological criteria. The CT scan of his chest was repeated two months later and showed complete resolution of the hilar lymphadenopathy without the use of steroid, which confirmed this association.

 Here is the patient note:
An 8-year-old Saudi girl developed persistent daily fever, weight loss, and cough for two months. Her grandmother had pulmonary tuberculosis 15 months prior to the onset of symptoms. The family sought medical advice first in a local hospital where investigations revealed bilateral pneumonia, left-sided pleural effusion, and bilateral pulmonary nodules. There was a history of animal contact but no raw milk ingestion. She had normal bowel habits with no jaundice, dysphagia or any other GI symptoms. She had no neurological, rheumatological, ophthalmologic, or dermatological symptoms. Physical examination revealed a pale girl, at 10th percentile for weight and height, and hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory examination was remarkable for anemia (hemoglobin 7.9 g/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 120 mm/h, and an alanine aminotransferase of 75 U/L (normal, 0-35 U/L), serum calcium 2.6 mmol/L, and low albumin level 31 g/L. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed hepatosplenomegaly and hypodense nonenhancing lesions throughout the liver (variable in size from a few millimeters to 3 centimeters), and multiple enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Chest CT scan showed basal and peripheral nodular opacities. Tests for mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) including tuberculin skin test and serum QuantiFERON showed negative results. Liver biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas []. In light of the strong epidemiological exposure, antituberculous medications were initiated (combination of isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and refampicin). Despite compliance with treatment and proper dosing, the patient persisted to be febrile with further weight loss.
Three months later, the patient presented with repeated episodes of hematemesis and epigastric pain. Upper endoscopy revealed an erosive, hemorrhagic, nodular gastric mucosa over the entire stomach []. Histopathology of biopsies revealed chronic noncaseating granulomatous inflammation and tests for MTB, and fungal infection on the gastric biopsies were negative. Tests for antibodies associated with inflammatory bowel disease (perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antiouter membrane protein C, and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae IgA and IgG) showed negative results. Oxidative burst test for chronic granulomatous disease was negative. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 45 U/L (normal, 29-110 U/L).
Given the multisystem involvement with significant chest findings, tissue findings of granulomatous disease from the liver and upper GIT, together with exclusion of other causes of granulomatous inflammation, the patient was diagnosed with active disseminated sarcoidosis, and intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day) and omeprazole were started. Ten days after steroid therapy, a repeat of upper endoscopy showed dramatic improvement in the esophageal and gastric appearance [], and a colonoscopy showed no colonic involvement and normal terminal ileum. Biopsies from the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum showed dramatic reduction in the inflammation and disappearance of the granulomatous changes. The corticosteroids were tapered over 3 months. At 6 months after diagnosis, chest and abdomen CT showed resolution of the hepatosplenomegaly, and clearance of the hypodense lesions. During the four years after the diagnosis, the child has remained in remission with normal growth and development.

We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 31.0 g Albmumin/10.0 dL = 3.1 g Albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 31.0 g Albmumin/L converts to 3.1 g Albmumin/dL. \nThe concentration of Calcium is 2.6 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of Calcium is 2.6 mmol. To convert 2.6 mmol of Calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.6 mmol Calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.003 mol Calcium. To convert from mol Calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.003 mol Calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.12 g Calcium. To convert 0.12 g of Calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.12 g Calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 120.0 mg Calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL.

 Here is the patient note:
A 40-year-old man presented with a 4-year history of hypertension treated with aldosterone receptor antagonist (ARA2) and in 2008 a left lithotripsy. He had a family history of type 2 diabetes and cancer (type not specified). He presented with left lumbar pain, dysuria, and hematuria that improved with antibiotic therapy, multiple analgesics, and spontaneous expulsion of a 0.5 × 0.5 cm calculus. During the urologic assessment, the renal ultrasound detected an incidental left adrenal tumor. In the next months, he developed leg cramps and early satiety and lost approximately 8 kg of body weight.
Laboratory examinations reported serum sodium 138 mEq/L (normal 135–145 mEq/L), potassium 4.5 mEq/L (normal 3.5–5 mEq/L), calcium 11.1 mg/dL (normal 8.4–10.2 mg/dL), phosphate 2.5 mg/dL (normal 2.7–4.5 mg/dL), magnesium 1.7 mg/dL (normal 1.6–2.6 mg/dL), and albumin 4.2 g/dL (normal 3.4–4.8 g/dL). PTHi was also elevated (151 pg/mL, normal: 10–65 pg/mL) and vitamin D was normal (30 ng/mL). The screening for adrenal incidentaloma included urinary-free cortisol level of 104.61 mg/24 h (normal < 130 mg/24 h), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate of 150 µg/dL (normal: 95–530 µg/dL), plasmatic aldosterone concentration (PAC) of 24.9 ng/dL, plasmatic renin activity (PRA) of 0.207 ng/mL/h, PAC/PRA (aldosterone/renin ratio) of 124.5 (normal < 30), urinary normetanephrine of 377 µg/24 h (normal 82–500 µg/24 h), and urinary metanephrine <28 µg/24 h (normal 45–290 µg/24 h).
After biochemical confirmation of hyperparathyroidism, a Tc99m-MIBI scintigraphy showed an abnormally increased tracer uptake in the right superior parathyroid (). The abdominal CT scan confirmed the presence of a giant left adrenal tumor (20 × 13 × 20 cm) (). Despite the kidney displacement due to the large tumor, there was no evidence of arterial stenosis. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism associated with an aldosterone-producing tumor (highly suspicious of malignancy) was made.
Blood pressure was treated with spironolactone and ARA2. During surgery, enlargement of both left and right parathyroid glands was observed and bilateral parathyroidectomy was successfully done with pathological diagnosis of diffuse hyperplasia of both glands. After surgery, serum calcium decreased to 9 mg/dL, phosphate decreased to 2.7 mg/dL, magnesium decreased to 2 mg/dL, and PTHi decreased to 48.75 pg/mL. Blood pressure was successfully controlled with medical therapy and a left adrenalectomy was performed 5 months later. Histologic study reported a 2750 g tumor with diffuse architecture, areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, and venous invasion, three of the nine criteria previously described by Weiss for malignant adrenal neoplasias which is compatible with the final diagnosis of adrenal adenocarcinoma []. Immunohistochemical analysis reported positivity to inhibin alpha and Melan-A (MART-1) and neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin and negativity to PS100 and chromogranin A, which confirmed the diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor. Unfortunately, we have no access to the molecular (RT-PCR) or immunohistochemistry techniques that could allow us to identify the type 1 PTH receptor in tissue samples.
After adrenalectomy, spironolactone was discontinued, blood pressure remained under control, and aldosterone levels were normal (6.1 ng/dL, normal < 10 ng/dL). Later, the patient had a generalized seizure and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a tumor in the right frontal area compatible with a metastatic lesion (). Afterwards, he presented with severe arm pain that did not respond well to analgesics. A muscular biopsy performed reported carcinoma metastases. Despite chemotherapy treatment, he died 9 months later.

Here is the task:
Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old female with a history of prior psychiatric hospitalization for suicidal ideation was brought to the emergency department, after being found confused, and wandering in a field. She was found to have two bags of diphenhydramine with her. The patient was not a reliable historian and on questioning initially admitted to taking the pills in an attempt to sleep.
On presentation to the emergency department, she was agitated and confused. On arrival, she was registered to have a temperature of 100.1 F, blood pressure of 188/111 mmHg, pulse rate of 129 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 20/min with oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.
On initial physical examination the patient appeared flushed, pupils had mydriasis, bilaterally dilated up to approximately 9 millimeters, and was non-reactive to light. Mucous membranes were dry, lungs were clear to auscultation. An abdominal examination revealed sluggish bowel sounds, neurological examination was not suggestive of focal neurological deficits. No evidence of trauma was identified. Signs, symptoms and physical examination on presentation, were consistent with anticholinergic toxicity.
Initial laboratory studies showed her to have WBC of 19.5 (RI 4.0–12.0 K/UL) with predominant neutrophils, hemoglobin 14.8 (RI 12.0–16.0 G/DL), BUN was 11 (RI 0–23 MG/DL), creatinine was 0.88(RI 0.00–1.11 MG/DL) sodium was 139 (RI 135–145 MEQ/L), potassium was 2.7 (RI 3.5–5.1 MEQ/L), AST 123 (RI 5–34 U/L), ALT 40 (RI 0–55 U/L), bicarbonate 19 (RI 20–31 MEQ/L), magnesium 2.5 (RI 1.6–2.6 MG/DL), calcium 10.3 (RI 8.4–10.2 MG/DL), albumin 4.8 (RI 3.3–4.7 MG/DL), phosphorus 1.4 (RI 2.3–4.7 MG/DL), TSH 1.058 (RI 0.350–5.50 UIU/ML). Cardiac troponin was found to be elevated at 0.32 (RI <0.10 ng/ml). Investigations that followed included urine toxicology, which was negative for Amphetamine, Benzodiazepine, Barbiturate, Cocaine, Opiates, Phencyclidine, Methadone, Propoxyphene, and Cannabinoids. Urinalysis revealed her to have hematuria, proteinuria of 100 MG/DL, urine ketone 20 MG/DL. Computerized tomography of the head revealed no acute intracranial abnormalities. Creatine Kinase levels were elevated at 17,274 U/L (normal 29–168), CK-MB 38.9 NG/ML (RI 5 to 25 IU/L).
Arterial blood gas on initial presentation showed pH 7.37, PaCo2 37.9, HCO3 21.7, Lactate 3.61, PO2 32.4. An Electrocardiogram obtained on presentation showed shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 99 beats/min with a QTC interval of 487 ms. Aggressive hydration with 0.9% normal saline was initiated. Over the next few hours, serial electrocardiograms showed development of a right bundle block with significant QTC interval prolongation, of 765 ms.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive care unit to monitor for deterioration. Given the patient’s prolonged QTC interval and the rhabdomyolysis, sodium bicarbonate infusion was initiated. Transthoracic echocardiogram was done suggesting a normal left ventricular function, with no structural or wall motion abnormalities. Decremental QTC intervals were seen on serial electrocardiograms.
There was an improvement in her mental status and stabilization of vital signs with supportive care and hydration. Creatinine kinase levels (CK), however continued to rise and peaked at 32,343 (29–168 U/L) by day 2 of her hospitalization. Thereafter, a declining trend in serum creatine kinase levels was seen with aggressive hydration. No renal compromise was observed. Serum creatine kinase at discharge was 211 U/L.
The patient was evaluated by psychiatry. She confessed to having overdosed on the medication to harm herself, she was started on antidepressant medications and was admitted to inpatient psychiatric facility for suicidal ideation.

Here is the task:
Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.

On arrival, she was registered to have a temperature of 100.1 F, blood pressure of 188/111 mmHg, pulse rate of 129 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 20/min with oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.\nOn initial physical examination the patient appeared flushed, pupils had mydriasis, bilaterally dilated up to approximately 9 millimeters, and was non-reactive to light. Mucous membranes were dry, lungs were clear to auscultation. An abdominal examination revealed sluggish bowel sounds, neurological examination was not suggestive of focal neurological deficits. No evidence of trauma was identified. Signs, symptoms and physical examination on presentation, were consistent with anticholinergic toxicity.\nInitial laboratory studies showed her to have WBC of 19.5 (RI 4.0–12.0 K/UL) with predominant neutrophils, hemoglobin 14.8 (RI 12.0–16.0 G/DL), BUN was 11 (RI 0–23 MG/DL), creatinine was 0.88(RI 0.00–1.11 MG/DL) sodium was 139 (RI 135–145 MEQ/L), potassium was 2.7 (RI 3.5–5.1 MEQ/L), AST 123 (RI 5–34 U/L), ALT 40 (RI 0–55 U/L), bicarbonate 19 (RI 20–31 MEQ/L), magnesium 2.5 (RI 1.6–2.6 MG/DL), calcium 10.3 (RI 8.4–10.2 MG/DL), albumin 4.8 (RI 3.3–4.7 MG/DL), phosphorus 1.4 (RI 2.3–4.7 MG/DL), TSH 1.058 (RI 0.350–5.50 UIU/ML). Cardiac troponin was found to be elevated at 0.32 (RI <0.10 ng/ml). Investigations that followed included urine toxicology, which was negative for Amphetamine, Benzodiazepine, Barbiturate, Cocaine, Opiates, Phencyclidine, Methadone, Propoxyphene, and Cannabinoids. Urinalysis revealed her to have hematuria, proteinuria of 100 MG/DL, urine ketone 20 MG/DL. Computerized tomography of the head revealed no acute intracranial abnormalities. Creatine Kinase levels were elevated at 17,274 U/L (normal 29–168), CK-MB 38.9 NG/ML (RI 5 to 25 IU/L).\nArterial blood gas on initial presentation showed pH 7.37, PaCo2 37.9, HCO3 21.7, Lactate 3.61, PO2 32.4. An Electrocardiogram obtained on presentation showed shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 99 beats/min with a QTC interval of 487 ms. Aggressive hydration with 0.9% normal saline was initiated. Over the next few hours, serial electrocardiograms showed development of a right bundle block with significant QTC interval prolongation, of 765 ms.\nThe patient was transferred to the Intensive care unit to monitor for deterioration. Given the patient’s prolonged QTC interval and the rhabdomyolysis, sodium bicarbonate infusion was initiated. Transthoracic echocardiogram was done suggesting a normal left ventricular function, with no structural or wall motion abnormalities. Decremental QTC intervals were seen on serial electrocardiograms.\nThere was an improvement in her mental status and stabilization of vital signs with supportive care and hydration. Creatinine kinase levels (CK), however continued to rise and peaked at 32,343 (29–168 U/L) by day 2 of her hospitalization. Thereafter, a declining trend in serum creatine kinase levels was seen with aggressive hydration. No renal compromise was observed. Serum creatine kinase at discharge was 211 U/L.\nThe patient was evaluated by psychiatry. She confessed to having overdosed on the medication to harm herself, she was started on antidepressant medications and was admitted to inpatient psychiatric facility for suicidal ideation.', 'Question': "Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.", 'LLM Answer': '9.66', 'LLM Explanation': "First, we need to identify the patient's albumin level from the patient note. It is mentioned that the patient's albumin level is 4.8 g/dL. Since we are asked to set the normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL, we will use this value.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old man presented to the the emergency system with severe dyspnea and hypoxia (SpO2: 87% in ambient air). His past medical history was significant for hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and chronic renal failure. On admission (day 1), he had a temperature of 39°C, high blood pressure (170/100 mmHg), and heart rate (110 bpm in sinus rhythm (SR)). Diffuse breath sounds (rales) were found on both lung fields and the chest HRCT [, Panel E] revealed bilateral GGOs consistent with interstitial inflammatory lung disease. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were immediately obtained, confirming SARS-CoV-2 positivity. After a CPAP attempt (days 1 and 2), the patient was intubated (day 3) with ventilatory support parameters demonstrating a high (PEEP of 15 cm H2O), FiO2 80%, and driving pressure <15 cmH2O. Serum creatinine increased to 2.3 mg/dL (glomerular filtration rate of 31 mL/min), leukocytes were 8.3 × 109 U/L, lymphocytes were 0.9 × 109 U/L, and hemoglobin was 9.3 g/dL. The high-sensitivity troponin T curve was 59-43–35 ng/L (normal value <14), NT-proBNP reached to 10.650 pg/mL (normal value <153) and C-reactive protein peak was 29 mg/L (normal value <6) with procalcitonin peak of 6.3 ng/mL (normal value range: 0–0.15). Interleuchin-6 values were 91.83 pg/mL and 37.63 pg/mL and he was treated with intravenous tocilizumab. Coagulation markers demonstrated a pro-thrombotic status with a platelet count of 160 × 109 U/L, D-dimer of 17 mcg/mL, fibrinogen of 656 mg/dL, and an aPTT of 33.8 s. ECG [, Panel F] showed atrial fibrillation with high heart rate (111 bpm), mild ST depression, inverted T waves in V4–V6, and a QTc of 437 ms. TTE revealed a moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 40%) with a mildly dilated left ventricle (end-diastolic diameter of 61 mm), normal right ventricle in size and function, and normal cardiac valves. There was a moderate pericardial effusion, anterior to the right ventricle (maximum 15 mm in diastole). A mobile and elongated (0.3 × 4 cm) clot was noted within the effusion (Panel G). The patient was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg BID), hydroxychloroquine (200 mg BID), and enoxaparin (1 mg/kg BID). Metilprednisolone (1 mg/kg OD) was added (day 6) together with beta-blockers, diuretics, and nitrates. Due to persistent atrial fibrillation, enoxaparin was switched to edoxaban (30 mg OD) on day 9. To date (day 15), the clot continues to decrease as seen on the chest HRCT (Panel H).
The prone position was used for the first four nights in the ICU. He was extubated the 15th day after intubation; noninvasive ventilation and HFNC were used the following days to optimize oxygenation.
At 6-month follow-up, the patient was in good conditions, lung lesions appeared reduced on chest HRCT, but at TTE pericardial clot appeared unchanged [].

 Here is the patient note:
A 14-year-old female presented to our pediatric tertiary hospital emergency department (ED) with acute dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain following a presyncopal episode while walking up a flight of stairs. She was persistently tachycardic with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute at rest and higher with minimal exertion, tachypneic (20 breaths per minute), normotensive (mean arterial pressure 80-88 mmHg) and had mild hypoxia with baseline saturations of approximately 90% at rest, decreasing to the mid-80s with mobilisation. She was commenced on supplemental low flow nasal oxygen at a flow rate of three litres per minute which improved her oxygen saturations.
The patient was otherwise well with no history of recent viral illness, surgery, trauma, or periods of immobilisation. She had however commenced a COCP consisting of ethinyloestradiol (20 micrograms) and levonorgestrel (100 micrograms) ten weeks prior. The COCP was prescribed by her local doctor for a sharp pelvic pain which started with menstruation and persisted for three weeks, with complete resolution while taking the COCP. The patient reached menarche at twelve years old and experienced dysmenorrhea for the first three days of menstruation with menorrhagia. Apart from her maternal grandmother having endometriosis, there was no significant family history including thrombophilia or thromboembolic events. The patient denied smoking or recreational drug use. She was a competitive sports player who, within a month of commencing the COCP, experienced dyspnea and intermittent chest pain on exertion. Although these symptoms initially resolved with rest, her time to recovery gradually increased.
In the ED, a chest X-ray (CXR) revealed mild prominence of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally. Blood tests revealed elevated levels of D-dimer, 5.01 mg/L (normal range 0.02–0.49) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) of 194 Hng/L (normal < 10). Given the history and clinical findings, a computer tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed and confirmed the presence of a saddle PE () with thrombus occluding the right main pulmonary artery, left upper lobe segmental artery, and left interlobar artery. There was also evidence of right heart strain on the CTPA. An urgent echocardiogram revealed systolic dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV) and basal segment dyskinesia, and blood flow through the right pulmonary artery appeared absent. Given the presence of right heart strain, elevated troponin levels, and persistent tachycardia and hypoxia, urgent opinions were sought from multiple pediatric specialists including a respiratory physician, interventional cardiologist, haematologist, and cardiothoracic surgeon.
The patient was administered a 10 milligram (mg) bolus of intravenous alteplase, a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) where she then received an infusion of tPA (0.3 mg/kg/h) for 3 hours. The total dose of tPA administered was 80 mg. Following this, the patient was commenced on an unfractionated heparin (UHF) infusion, targeting an anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.7 U/mL. COCP administration was ceased.
Following thrombolysis, the patient's tachycardia resolved, although she remained tachypneic. A repeat echocardiogram within twelve hours showed improvement in the RV systolic dysfunction and definite blood movement through the right pulmonary artery, with ongoing presence of a significant filling defect occupying the vessel. UHF infusion was continued for 48 hours, after which time anticoagulation was changed to 80 mg subcutaneous enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), administered twice a day. Given the significant embolic material seen on the initial CTPA, further discussions ensued regarding the potential benefits and risks of catheter-directed intervention with the aim of decreasing clot burden and potentially reducing the risk of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).
A repeat CTPA was performed on the fourth day of admission which revealed a substantial decrease in clot burden, no visible saddle embolus, and reduced right heart strain (). The patient no longer required supplemental oxygen and made a steady recovery. Eight days post admission, she was transitioned to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), rivaroxaban, at standard adult dosing (15 mg twice a day for three weeks followed by 20 mg daily), prior to discharge home.
A thrombophilia screen performed was unremarkable (). She was referred to an adolescent gynaecologist to explore suitable alternatives to taking the COCP. Outpatient spirometry, body plethysmography, and diffusing capacity tests performed a month post discharge were unremarkable. She returned to her baseline function with resolution of the shortness of breath on exertion. A CTPA and echocardiogram performed six months post presentation revealed complete resolution of all pathological changes, and rivaroxaban therapy was stopped (). Written consent was obtained from the patient's parent for this case report.

Given the presence of right heart strain, elevated troponin levels, and persistent tachycardia and hypoxia, urgent opinions were sought from multiple pediatric specialists including a respiratory physician, interventional cardiologist, haematologist, and cardiothoracic surgeon. The patient was administered a 10 milligram (mg) bolus of intravenous alteplase, a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) where she then received an infusion of tPA (0.3 mg/kg/h) for 3 hours. The total dose of tPA administered was 80 mg. Following this, the patient was commenced on an unfractionated heparin (UHF) infusion, targeting an anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.7 U/mL. COCP administration was ceased. Following thrombolysis, the patient's tachycardia resolved, although she remained tachypneic. A repeat echocardiogram within twelve hours showed improvement in the RV systolic dysfunction and definite blood movement through the right pulmonary artery, with ongoing presence of a significant filling defect occupying the vessel. UHF infusion was continued for 48 hours, after which time anticoagulation was changed to 80 mg subcutaneous enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), administered twice a day. Given the significant embolic material seen on the initial CTPA, further discussions ensued regarding the potential benefits and risks of catheter-directed intervention with the aim of decreasing clot burden and potentially reducing the risk of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). A repeat CTPA was performed on the fourth day of admission which revealed a substantial decrease in clot burden, no visible saddle embolus, and reduced right heart strain (). The patient no longer required supplemental oxygen and made a steady recovery. Eight days post admission, she was transitioned to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), rivaroxaban, at standard adult dosing (15 mg twice a day for three weeks followed by 20 mg daily), prior to discharge home. A thrombophilia screen performed was unremarkable (). She was referred to an adolescent gynaecologist to explore suitable alternatives to taking the COCP. Outpatient spirometry, body plethysmography, and diffusing capacity tests performed a month post discharge were unremarkable. She returned to her baseline function with resolution of the shortness of breath on exertion. A CTPA and echocardiogram performed six months post presentation revealed complete resolution of all pathological changes, and rivaroxaban therapy was stopped (). Written consent was obtained from the patient's parent for this case report. Here is the task: What is the patient’s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?

She was persistently tachycardic with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute at rest and higher with minimal exertion, tachypneic (20 breaths per minute), normotensive (mean arterial pressure 80-88 mmHg) and had mild hypoxia with baseline saturations of approximately 90% at rest, decreasing to the mid-80s with mobilisation. She was commenced on supplemental low flow nasal oxygen at a flow rate of three litres per minute which improved her oxygen saturations.\nThe patient was otherwise well with no history of recent viral illness, surgery, trauma, or periods of immobilisation. She had however commenced a COCP consisting of ethinyloestradiol (20 micrograms) and levonorgestrel (100 micrograms) ten weeks prior. The COCP was prescribed by her local doctor for a sharp pelvic pain which started with menstruation and persisted for three weeks, with complete resolution while taking the COCP. The patient reached menarche at twelve years old and experienced dysmenorrhea for the first three days of menstruation with menorrhagia. Apart from her maternal grandmother having endometriosis, there was no significant family history including thrombophilia or thromboembolic events. The patient denied smoking or recreational drug use. She was a competitive sports player who, within a month of commencing the COCP, experienced dyspnea and intermittent chest pain on exertion. Although these symptoms initially resolved with rest, her time to recovery gradually increased.\nIn the ED, a chest X-ray (CXR) revealed mild prominence of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally. Blood tests revealed elevated levels of D-dimer, 5.01 mg/L (normal range 0.02–0.49) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) of 194 Hng/L (normal < 10).

 Here is the patient note:
An 18-year-old lady presented with generalised fatigue and excessive bleeding per vaginum for a two-month period. She also had blurring of vision associated with fever and headache for 15 days. The patient complained of pain in the anal region while passing stools for the last one week.
On examination, she was severely pale with an initial pulse rate of 100/min and a blood pressure of 100/70mm Hg. On local examination, she was found to have anal fissures.
On investigating, her peripheral smear revealed pancytopenia with a haemoglobin of 4 g%, total leucocyte count of 490/cu mm and a platelet count of 13000/cu mm. Her bone marrow biopsy was diagnostic of aplastic anaemia. An ophthalmological examination by fundoscopy and a B-scan ultrasonography (USG) was done and she was found to have bilateral vitreous haemorrhage and retinopathy.
She was transfused with multiple units of packed red cells and platelets. She was started on medroxy-progesterone acetate and tranexamic acid for menorrhagia along with iron and folate tablets. She was given cyclosporine for aplastic anaemia. In view of high fever spikes of 103 to 104 degrees F, she was started on empirical ceftazidime and amikacin. Her fever could not be localised and her initial blood and urine cultures were sterile. She had persistent fever and was switched over to meropenam and then to vancomycin.
After one week her perianal pain worsened and she passed blood clots per rectum associated with pus discharge. Her anal canal was extremely tender. Computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis showed features suggestive of perianal abscess with proctitis and sloughed out mucosa in the anal canal (Figure ).
On examination under anaesthesia, the following findings were noted: the entire anal canal from the anal verge to about 10 cm proximal appeared dark brown in colour with sloughed out mucosa, the sphincters appeared non-viable, the tone was lost, and there was no bleeding on cutting through the tissues. The anal canal was filled with foul-smelling necrotic tissues mixed with blood clots (Figure ).
Debridement of the necrotic devitalised tissues was done and the pus collection was drained (Figure ). A diversion transverse colostomy was made. She was started on piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin.
Gram stain of necrotic tissues revealed gram-positive bacilli suggestive of Clostridium along with budding yeast cells. Her subsequent blood cultures grew Clostridium spp and then Escherichia coli (intermediate sensitivity to imipenam) and Acinetobacter baumanii (resistant to all). Her total leucocyte count dropped down to 270/cu mm with an absolute neutrophil count of 30/cu mm. Her general condition worsened. She developed acidosis with the deterioration of vitals. She was resuscitated and was given mechanical ventilation. The patient died of severe sepsis on post-operative day 3.

 Here is the patient note:
A woman in her 40s was diagnosed with ADPKD after a renal ultrasound was performed due to hypertension and deranged kidney function on a routine blood test. At that point, she had a slightly enlarged liver with normal liver function tests and massive renal cysts. She reached ESRD requiring RRT in 2005 and received a deceased donor kidney transplant 2 years later. She developed progressive graft dysfunction due to chronic allograft nephropathy that required starting PD in August 2014. In November 2014, she was admitted to our hospital with a 3-week history of lower limb edema with painful skin ulcers, symptomatic hypotension and tachycardia (118 bpm), anorexia, nausea, and incoercible vomiting. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 70/45 mm Hg and ulcers with necrotic areas and cellulitis in the external distal third of both legs. Laboratory findings revealed severe malnutrition (serum albumin 1.5 g/dL) and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 288 mg/L; procalcitonin: 1.9 μg/L). A Doppler ultrasound showed bilateral femoral vein thrombosis, and so pulmonary thromboembolism was ruled out and due to the extensive thrombosis, a complete hypercoagulability state check was done, but no abnormalities were detected and tumor markers were normal. An abdominal CT was then performed showing large liver and renal polycystic disease, both organs with giant cysts (>15 cm). A giant hepatic cyst producing an extrinsic compression of the intrahepatic inferior cava vein (ICV) and massive venous thrombosis from ICV to bilateral iliofemoral deep veins involving the kidney graft vein was observed. The CT also demonstrated displacement and extrinsic compression of the stomach, pylorus, and duodenum due to another enlarged liver cyst, shown in Figures and .
After the CT findings, we considered the clinical presentation was consistent with an ICV syndrome due to ICV compression and thrombosis. Furthermore, vomiting and oral intake intolerance with severe malnutrition were caused by a complete pyloric and duodenal collapse by the enlarged liver cyst.
Anticoagulation therapy was started, but vomiting with oral intolerance persisted and the patient remained dependent on parenteral nutrition. Thus, percutaneous drainage and alcohol sclerosis of the compressive liver cyst was decided, with successful return of the stomach to its normal location, shown in Figure . Nausea and vomiting resolved in a few days, and adequate oral intake was resumed. Severe hypotension and tachycardia gradually improved, and a repeated CT revealed complete stomach expansion, as shown in Figure . PD therapy was modified but not disrupted, and 1 year later, the patient remained asymptomatic. As she did not have any coagulation abnormalities nor any evidence of neoplasia, the massive thrombosis of the ICV was deemed secondary to the extrinsic compression of intrahepatic ICV by enlarged liver cysts.

Here is the task:
What is the patient’s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?

At that point, she had a slightly enlarged liver with normal liver function tests and massive renal cysts. She reached ESRD requiring RRT in 2005 and received a deceased donor kidney transplant 2 years later. She developed progressive graft dysfunction due to chronic allograft nephropathy that required starting PD in August 2014. In November 2014, she was admitted to our hospital with a 3-week history of lower limb edema with painful skin ulcers, symptomatic hypotension and tachycardia (118 bpm), anorexia, nausea, and incoercible vomiting. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 70/45 mm Hg and ulcers with necrotic areas and cellulitis in the external distal third of both legs. Laboratory findings revealed severe malnutrition (serum albumin 1.5 g/dL) and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 288 mg/L; procalcitonin: 1.9 μg/L). A Doppler ultrasound showed bilateral femoral vein thrombosis, and so pulmonary thromboembolism was ruled out and due to the extensive thrombosis, a complete hypercoagulability state check was done, but no abnormalities were detected and tumor markers were normal. An abdominal CT was then performed showing large liver and renal polycystic disease, both organs with giant cysts (>15 cm). A giant hepatic cyst producing an extrinsic compression of the intrahepatic inferior cava vein (ICV) and massive venous thrombosis from ICV to bilateral iliofemoral deep veins involving the kidney graft vein was observed. The CT also demonstrated displacement and extrinsic compression of the stomach, pylorus, and duodenum due to another enlarged liver cyst, shown in Figures and . After the CT findings, we considered the clinical presentation was consistent with an ICV syndrome due to ICV compression and thrombosis.

 Here is the patient note:
Our patient was a 48-year-old female with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who presented to the hospital with a two-week history of dry cough, fever, red conjunctiva, chills, malaise, myalgias, and generalized weakness. She reported a weight loss of 15 pounds in the past year. She had been a smoker but had quit five years prior to the presentation. Prior to this hospital visit, she had consulted an outpatient clinic with complaints of fever, chills, and cough. She had received a flu vaccine a month prior. She had been thought to have a viral respiratory infection as an outpatient. Ibuprofen, and later azithromycin, had been prescribed, which had not alleviated her initial symptoms before the current presentation.
On physical exam, she had a temperature of 39.3 °C in the emergency department. She was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure was 149/74 mmHg. She had bilateral conjunctival injection, but her eyelids were grossly unremarkable. There was left axillary lymphadenopathy. A physical breast exam was normal with no palpable masses. There was no other palpable adenopathy, skin rashes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, clubbing, or edema. The respiratory and cardiovascular exams were otherwise unremarkable. Her ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per minute but was otherwise unremarkable.
Relevant laboratory workup included a leukocytosis of 16.7 Thou/uL (normal range: 3.8-10.2) with a neutrophilic predominance of 82.9%. She had chronic anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.9 g/dl (11.9-15.1) and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 fL (78.2-98.4). Her ferritin was more than 7,500 ng/ml (11-307), with a total iron-binding capacity of 204 (250-450), and a low iron level of 37 ug/dl (50-212). Her angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 97 U/l (8-52). Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 19.05 mg/dl (0.02-1.00), D-dimer was 13.46 ugFEU/ml (<0.50), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 54 U/L (13-39), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 66 U/L (7-52); she had calcium of 9.0 mg/dl (8.6-10.2), albumin of 3.0 g/dl (3.5-5.0), corrected calcium of 9.8 mg/dl, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level of 22.4 ng/ml (30-100), creatinine of 1.11 mg/dl (0.49-1.01), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 344 U/L (140-271).
The patient had not undergone a prior mammogram. A CT angiography (CTA) was performed, which ruled out any pulmonary embolus. There was no evidence of a pulmonary embolus, or pulmonary nodules, or infiltrates. However, the CTA revealed right hilar lymphadenopathy of 1.3 cm in size and subcarinal lymphadenopathy of 1.1 cm (Figures , ).
A CT of the abdomen revealed a cystic mass of the left retroperitoneum measuring 14 x 11 x 6 cm. The official radiology report suggested that it was of a benign etiology, which could include cystic lymphangioma, mesenteric cyst, or duplication cyst. A cystic neoplasm was considered unlikely in the radiology report. The patient was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin as well as intravenous fluids to treat a possible unknown infective source while awaiting cultures and further investigation. It was initially thought that a respiratory or abdominal source was the possible infective foci, which guided the selection of antibiotics.
The infectious disease team suspected an intrabdominal or lung infective etiology. An initial differential by the infectious diseases specialists, aside from infection, also included lymphoma and autoimmune processes such as sarcoidosis. The pulmonology team later advised that there was no evidence of pneumonia or tracheobronchitis. The hematology team emphasized the need to rule out lymphoma. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures were all negative. Antibiotics were initially tapered to ceftriaxone and metronidazole and then completely discontinued on day six. Drainage of the abdominal cyst revealed 250 mL of pale straw-colored serous fluid. Fluid chemistries were negative for an infectious or malignant etiology.
The patient underwent extensive investigation. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, serum creatine kinase levels, serum HIV tests, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, an acute hepatitis panel, three acid-fast sputum stains, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test, anti-SS-A antibody levels, anti-SS-B antibody levels, and urinalysis were all normal. She did, however, test positive for an antinuclear antibody (ANA) speckled+ pattern. The ANA titer was 1:320. The double-stranded DNA antibody levels were within the normal range at 49 Iu/ml (<200 Iu/ml). A bone marrow biopsy of the iliac crest showed no evidence of malignancy or acid-fast bacilli.
Surgery was consulted for an excisional lymph node biopsy of the left axillary lymph node. The sample was a solid tan nodular-appearing tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Biopsy revealed numerous non-caseating epithelioid granulomas present in the lymphoid tissue. Stains were negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungus. The biopsy results were consistent with sarcoidosis. Flow cytometry later showed no evidence of B or T cell lymphoma.
A tentative diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. The granulomatous disease is seen only in sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or fungal infections. The non-caseating granulomatous disease in the lymph nodes pointed most closely to sarcoidosis. The pulmonologist considered this to be a case of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis because only hilar nodes were involved without any lung parenchymal involvement. It was thought conceivable that the ANA elevation may have been related to sarcoidosis, although we agreed to continue to monitor the patient for other collagen vascular diseases.
During the hospitalization, the patient had daily high-grade fevers. The fevers were intermittent, daily, variable, and went from 38.4 to a high of 39.4 °C. The patient was also seen by ophthalmology, and she was diagnosed with blepharitis. No uveitis or episcleritis was noted. She was treated with eye drops containing steroids, antimicrobials, and artificial tears. She was started on prednisone 40 mg PO daily with outpatient follow-up. Her fever and ocular symptoms resolved. She was seen in an outpatient clinic prior to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and then moved to a different location.

Here is the task:
What is the patient’s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?

{'Row Number': 124, 'Calculator Name': "Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism", 'Calculator ID': '8', 'Category': 'risk', 'Note ID': 'pmc-8293858-1', 'Patient Note': 'Our patient was a 48-year-old female with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who presented to the hospital with a two-week history of dry cough, fever, red conjunctiva, chills, malaise, myalgias, and generalized weakness. She reported a weight loss of 15 pounds in the past year. She had been a smoker but had quit five years prior to the presentation. Prior to this hospital visit, she had consulted an outpatient clinic with complaints of fever, chills, and cough. She had received a flu vaccine a month prior. She had been thought to have a viral respiratory infection as an outpatient. Ibuprofen, and later azithromycin, had been prescribed, which had not alleviated her initial symptoms before the current presentation.\nOn physical exam, she had a temperature of 39.3 °C in the emergency department. She was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure was 149/74 mmHg. She had bilateral conjunctival injection, but her eyelids were grossly unremarkable. There was left axillary lymphadenopathy. A physical breast exam was normal with no palpable masses. There was no other palpable adenopathy, skin rashes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, clubbing, or edema. The respiratory and cardiovascular exams were otherwise unremarkable. Her ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per minute but was otherwise unremarkable.\nRelevant laboratory workup included a leukocytosis of 16.7 Thou/uL (normal range: 3.8-10.2) with a neutrophilic predominance of 82.9%. She had chronic anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.9 g/dl (11.9-15.1) and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 fL (78.2-98.4). Her ferritin was more than 7,500 ng/ml (11-307), with a total iron-binding capacity of 204 (250-450), and a low iron level of 37 ug/dl (50-212). Her angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 97 U/l (8-52). Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 19.05 mg/dl (0.02-1.00), D-dimer was 13.46 ugFEU/ml (<0.50), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 54 U/L (13-39), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 66 U/L (7-52); she had calcium of 9.0 mg/dl (8.6-10.2), albumin of 3.0 g/dl (3.5-5.0), corrected calcium of 9.8 mg/dl, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level of 22.4 ng/ml (30-100), creatinine of 1.11 mg/dl (0.49-1.01), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 344 U/L (140-271).\nThe patient had not undergone a prior mammogram. A CT angiography (CTA) was performed, which ruled out any pulmonary embolus. There was no evidence of a pulmonary embolus, or pulmonary nodules, or infiltrates. However, the CTA revealed right hilar lymphadenopathy of 1.3 cm in size and subcarinal lymphadenopathy of 1.1 cm (Figures , ).\nA CT of the abdomen revealed a cystic mass of the left retroperitoneum measuring 14 x 11 x 6 cm. The official radiology report suggested that it was of a benign etiology, which could include cystic lymphangioma, mesenteric cyst, or duplication cyst. A cystic neoplasm was considered unlikely in the radiology report. The patient was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin as well as intravenous fluids to treat a possible unknown infective source while awaiting cultures and further investigation. It was initially thought that a respiratory or abdominal source was the possible infective foci, which guided the selection of antibiotics.\nThe infectious disease team suspected an intrabdominal or lung infective etiology. An initial differential by the infectious diseases specialists, aside from infection, also included lymphoma and autoimmune processes such as sarcoidosis. The pulmonology team later advised that there was no evidence of pneumonia or tracheobronchitis. The hematology team emphasized the need to rule out lymphoma. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures were all negative. Antibiotics were initially tapered to ceftriaxone and metronidazole and then completely discontinued on day six. Drainage of the abdominal cyst revealed 250 mL of pale straw-colored serous fluid. Fluid chemistries were negative for an infectious or malignant etiology.\nThe patient underwent extensive investigation. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, serum creatine kinase levels, serum HIV tests, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, an acute hepatitis panel, three acid-fast sputum stains, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test, anti-SS-A antibody levels, anti-SS-B antibody levels, and urinalysis were all normal. She did, however, test positive for an antinuclear antibody (ANA) speckled+ pattern. The ANA titer was 1:320. The double-stranded DNA antibody levels were within the normal range at 49 Iu/ml (<200 Iu/ml). A bone marrow biopsy of the iliac crest showed no evidence of malignancy or acid-fast bacilli.\nSurgery was consulted for an excisional lymph node biopsy of the left axillary lymph node. The sample was a solid tan nodular-appearing tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Biopsy revealed numerous non-caseating epithelioid granulomas present in the lymphoid tissue. Stains were negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungus. The biopsy results were consistent with sarcoidosis. Flow cytometry later showed no evidence of B or T cell lymphoma.\nA tentative diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. The granulomatous disease is seen only in sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or fungal infections. The non-caseating granulomatous disease in the lymph nodes pointed most closely to sarcoidosis. The pulmonologist considered this to be a case of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis because only hilar nodes were involved without any lung parenchymal involvement. It was thought conceivable that the ANA elevation may have been related to sarcoidosis, although we agreed to continue to monitor the patient for other collagen vascular diseases.\nDuring the hospitalization, the patient had daily high-grade fevers. The fevers were intermittent, daily, variable, and went from 38.4 to a high of 39.4 °C. The patient was also seen by ophthalmology, and she was diagnosed with blepharitis. No uveitis or episcleritis was noted. She was treated with eye drops containing steroids, antimicrobials, and artificial tears. She was started on prednisone 40 mg PO daily with outpatient follow-up. Her fever and ocular symptoms resolved. She was seen in an outpatient clinic prior to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and then moved to a different location.', 'Question': "What is the patient’s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Explanation': "name 'N' is not defined", 'Ground Truth Answer': '1.5', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.\nClinical signs and symptoms of DVT are repoted to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old man presents to the doctor’s office with shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue for 3 days. This has been progressively worsening. He has a medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis. He takes albuterol, ipratropium and aspirin. He smoked 2 and a half packs per day, and had done so for the past 26 years. After ceasing tobacco use for 1 year, he has recently begun smoking again. The blood pressure is 138/88 mm Hg, the respiratory rate is 12/min, the heart rate is 76/min, and the pulse oximetry is 87% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears disoriented and is only somewhat comprehensible. The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light with extraocular movements intact. Cranial nerves VII-XII also intact. The auscultation of the heart is absent of murmur, rubs, or gallops. The auscultation of the lungs demonstrate audible rales in the bases bilaterally.

Here is the task:

 Here is the patient note:
A 12-year-old girl was referred to the dental department for the assessment of a long-standing nonhealing ulcer on the labial mucosa of the lower lip. The lesion was first observed by the patient 2 years ago; however, the lesion was brought to the notice of the parents 6 months back which prompted them to seek the treatment. The patient had no symptoms otherwise. The size of the ulcer has remained constant over the past 2 years. There was no history of cough, fever, hemoptysis, and weight loss. She did not have any systemic condition, had no history of allergy, and was not on any medications.
She had consulted two dental practitioners in her village and was treated conservatively with the help of topical medications over the past 6 months. The older prescriptions revealed the use of mucopain gel (benzocaine 1.P. 20%), zytee gel (benzalkonium chloride 0.02%, choline salicylate 9%), and candid mouth paint (clotrimazole 1%). However, there was no change (increase or decrease in the size of the ulcer) or improvement in her clinical condition for the past 6 months.
General physical examination revealed that she weighed 33 kg and was 150 cm tall. The calculated body mass index of 14.7 kg/m2 indicated that she was underweight. Vital signs (heart rate – 82 beats/min, respiratory rate – 16 breaths/min, blood pressure – 120/80 mmHg, body temperature – 98.6°F) were within the normal range. Submandibular and submental groups of lymph nodes were examined and they were nonpalpable and nontender.
Oral examination revealed a round nonhealing ulcer on the labial mucosa of the lower lip on the left side measuring 4 cm × 4 cm. The ulcer was grayish-white in color with irregular borders. The edges were thin and undermined with slight induration at the base []. There was no tenderness on palpation. An incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia. The microscopy section from the lower lip showed the hyperplastic squamous epithelium, multiple granulomas composed of epithelioid cells and Langhan's giant cells, surrounded by lymphocytes and plasma cells []. No caseous necrosis was seen in the biopsy sample obtained. A preliminary diagnosis of TB/sarcoidosis was made.
Blood tests revealed a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (18 mm in the 1st h). The serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level was 58.2 U/L. Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) (Quantiferon-TB [QFT]) was positive (3.43 IU/mL). Results of Mantoux test interpreted 48 h after tuberculin injection (10 T.U) revealed erythema of 16 mm and induration of 18 mm. The chest radiograph revealed the absence of foci of infection indicating no pulmonary involvement. Thus, the diagnosis of primary TB was confirmed.
Treatment with anti-tubercular drugs was initiated. The patient was prescribed isoniazid 150 mg, rifampin 300 mg, pyrazinamide 750 mg, and ethambutol 400 mg daily for 2 months. The second phase of the treatment consisted of isoniazid 150 mg and rifampin 300 mg daily for 4 months. Lesion almost resolved within 3 weeks of initiation of the treatment [].

The patient has a non-healing ulcer on the labial mucosa of the lower lip, which is diagnosed as primary TB. The patient's vital signs, including heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, are within the normal range. There is no mention of dyspnea, chest pain, or hemoptysis, which are common symptoms of PE. Therefore, the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism is 0.

The lesion was first observed by the patient 2 years ago; however, the lesion was brought to the notice of the parents 6 months back which prompted them to seek the treatment. The patient had no symptoms otherwise. The size of the ulcer has remained constant over the past 2 years. There was no history of cough, fever, hemoptysis, and weight loss. She did not have any systemic condition, had no history of allergy, and was not on any medications.\nShe had consulted two dental practitioners in her village and was treated conservatively with the help of topical medications over the past 6 months. The older prescriptions revealed the use of mucopain gel (benzocaine 1.P. 20%), zytee gel (benzalkonium chloride 0.02%, choline salicylate 9%), and candid mouth paint (clotrimazole 1%). However, there was no change (increase or decrease in the size of the ulcer) or improvement in her clinical condition for the past 6 months.\nGeneral physical examination revealed that she weighed 33 kg and was 150 cm tall. The calculated body mass index of 14.7 kg/m2 indicated that she was underweight. Vital signs (heart rate – 82 beats/min, respiratory rate – 16 breaths/min, blood pressure – 120/80 mmHg, body temperature – 98.6°F) were within the normal range. Submandibular and submental groups of lymph nodes were examined and they were nonpalpable and nontender.\nOral examination revealed a round nonhealing ulcer on the labial mucosa of the lower lip on the left side measuring 4 cm × 4 cm. The ulcer was grayish-white in color with irregular borders. The edges were thin and undermined with slight induration at the base []. There was no tenderness on palpation. An incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia. The microscopy section from the lower lip showed the hyperplastic squamous epithelium, multiple granulomas composed of epithelioid cells and Langhan's giant cells, surrounded by lymphocytes and plasma cells []. No caseous necrosis was seen in the biopsy sample obtained. A preliminary diagnosis of TB/sarcoidosis was made.\nBlood tests revealed a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (18 mm in the 1st h). The serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level was 58.2 U/L. Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) (Quantiferon-TB [QFT]) was positive (3.43 IU/mL). Results of Mantoux test interpreted 48 h after tuberculin injection (10 T.U) revealed erythema of 16 mm and induration of 18 mm. The chest radiograph revealed the absence of foci of infection indicating no pulmonary involvement. Thus, the diagnosis of primary TB was confirmed.\nTreatment with anti-tubercular drugs was initiated. The patient was prescribed isoniazid 150 mg, rifampin 300 mg, pyrazinamide 750 mg, and ethambutol 400 mg daily for 2 months. The second phase of the treatment consisted of isoniazid 150 mg and rifampin 300 mg daily for 4 months.

 Here is the patient note:
A 15-year-old female presented to our emergency department with four episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures over the past 24 h. On examination, she was pale and drowsy, but devoid of any focal motor deficit. Her blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, pulse rate was 108/min, temperature was 36.8 degree Celsius, and random blood sugar level was 112 mg/dL. Two months prior to presenting to us, she started experiencing recurrent episodes of vague abdominal pain, which would last for several minutes to hours and resolve spontaneously. Two weeks earlier, she had a similar episode associated with acute urinary retention, for which she was treated with injection furosemide, injection amikacin, injection pantoprazole, and laxative elsewhere.
Evaluation in our hospital revealed anemia with hemoglobin of 9.2 g%, total white blood count of 10,300 cells/cu.mm, differential count showing 85% polymorphs, 13% lymphocytes, 2% eosinophils, and platelet count of 3.12 lakh cells/cu.mm. Peripheral smear study revealed normochromic normocytic anemia. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Her blood urea was 17 mg/dL and serum creatinine-1.1 mg/dL. Serum electrolytes showed presence of hyponatremia (Sodium = 103 mEq/dL) and hypokalemia (Potassium = 3.0 mEq/dL). Her magnesium was 3.9 mg/dL and phosphorus was 4.1 mg/dL. Initial computed tomography imaging of the brain was unremarkable.
She was euvolemic, and in view of acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia and hypokalemia, she was treated with intravenous 3% saline and potassium infusion. She was also initiated on intravenous phenytoin at a loading dose of 15 mg/kg followed by maintenance dose of 100 mg thrice a day for seizures. After 3 days of treatment, she recovered without any neurological deficit and her sodium and potassium levels gradually became normal.
Two days later, she developed status epilepticus again. Her electrolytes revealed sodium of 111 mEq/dL and potassium of 2.3 mEq/dL. She was again initiated on intravenous 3% saline and potassium supplements. She recovered without any neurological deficit. Her repeat urinalysis was normal.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe and subcortical U-fibers, in which case, the differentials thought of were posterior reversible encephalopathy, extra pontine myelinolysis, and post-ictal changes. However, in the absence of an acute rise in blood pressure and renal failure, posterior reversible encephalopathy was unlikely.
She was clinically euvolemic. Hyponatremia evaluation revealed serum sodium of 111 mEq/dL, serum osmolality of 244 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality of 440 mOsm/kg, urine sodium of 88 mEq/dL, serum uric acid of 2.8 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, serum cortisol of 15 mg/dL, and thyroid-stimulating hormone of 3.5 mIU/L. She was not on any diuretics. Hence, a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) secretion was entertained. On evaluation, there was no evidence of any infection, organic neurological disorders, or malignancy. She was not on any antipsychotic therapy.
During the hospital stay, she continued to have muscle cramps with severe spasmodic episodes of abdominal pain, which now subsided on treatment with opioids. Ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed sludge in the gall bladder, normal-sized kidneys, normal pelvicalyceal system, and a normal urinary bladder. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed multiple tiny gall stones. Serum Amylase (275.9 U/L) and lipase (486.4 U/L) were elevated. During this episode of acute abdomen, her urine was noticed to have a reddish hue, which did not further change color on standing. Repeat urinalysis did not show any active sediments.
For the management of symptomatic gallstones, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was contemplated. Meanwhile, she again presented with acute abdominal pain and was treated with opioids. During this episode, her urine was noticed to be of port-wine color, which aroused a strong suspicion of porphyria. Hence we proceeded with the screening test for porphyria, i.e, the Watson Schwartz method which turned out to be positive [Figures and ] Also examination under ultraviolet lamp showed pink fluorescence at 410 nm. A 24-h urinary assay for porphobilinogen (PBG) and aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was done and they turned out to be normal, probably because it was done after the acute episode had subsided. However, with a strong suspicion of porphyria, analysis of the hydroxymethybilane synthase (HMBS) gene encoding HMBS was done using targeted next-generation sequencing. It revealed a heterozygous missense variant in exon 13 of the HMBS gene on chromosome 11 that resulted in the amino acid substitution of arginine for glycine at codon 280 (chr11:g. 118963657G>A; Depth of coverage: 60×) (p.Gly280Arg; ENST00000278715.3). The observed variant lies in the porphobilinogen deaminase and C-terminal domain of the HMBS protein and has previously been reported in a patient affected with acute intermittent porphyria, thus confirming the diagnosis in our patient.[] She was started on intravenous glucose following which she became better. Anticonvulsants were stopped. She was advised high carbohydrate diet with added salt, lifelong. She is currently doing well and is on an OPD basis follow-ups.

 Here is the patient note:
A 37-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) in police custody for “medical clearance” before being taken to jail. The patient was approached by police officers for suspicion of selling illicit drugs. When approached by police he ran away and was witnessed to swallow several small plastic baggies suspected to contain heroin. He was apprehended and brought to the ED. On arrival, he was asymptomatic with a blood pressure 144/83mmHg, heart rate 67bpm, respiratory rate of 19bpm, oxygen saturation of 99% on room air and afebrile. A Glasgow coma score was 15 and he was alert and oriented to person, place and time. Patient had a negative review of systems. On physical examination pupils were 4mm and reactive to light, lungs clear to auscultation and had normal respiratory rate with normal cardiovascular exam. Abdomen was soft, non-tender and non-distended with present bowel sounds. The patient admitted to ingesting approximately 20 packets of heroin to avoid being charged with possession. The patient declined activated charcoal and whole bowel irrigation (WBI) with polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution (PEG-ELS). The patient declined a urine toxicology immunoassay screen. A computed tomography (CT) of his abdomen with contrast was obtained and read as normal except for a cluster of foreign bodies within the distal stomach likely contained within a plastic bag ( and ).

 Here is the patient note:
A 13 year-old boy presented with fever and not swollen discomfort of the right elbow without swelling and tenderness. Four months previously, he had been diagnosed to have Ewing sarcoma of the right ilium and had undergone five cycles of preoperative chemotherapy. He had contracted a C. tropicalis urinary tract infection during a febrile neutropenia episode after chemotherapy, which was treated with itraconazole and broad spectrum antibiotics for 7 days. No growth was reported in the last urine culture after itraconazole treatment. Recently, he had been on preoperative chemotherapy (vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide), which he had completed 9 days prior to presentation.
At presentation, his body temperature was 37.5℃, pulse rate 120 per minute, respiration rate 20 per minute, and blood pressure 130/70 mmHg. physical examination revealed a slight throat infection, but no sinus tenderness, nor tonsilar nor lymph node enlargement. Heart and lung sounds were normal, liver and spleen were non-palpable, and no edema or pain was found in the lower extremities. He complained of discomfort of the right elbow. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia, and complete blood count findings were leukocytes 160/mm3, absolute neutrophil count 40/mm3, hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count 8,000/mm3. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacilin/tazobactam and isepacin) were immediately administered after obtaining blood and urine for culture studies.
After two days of antibiotic treatment, mild tenderness and swelling (without heating sensation) were detected on the right elbow. A simple radiograph obtained on the 3rd hospital day revealed soft tissue swelling with a positive fat pad sign (). Ultrasonography on the 4th hospital day showed soft tissue edema and articular effusion, and subsequently, 15 mL of yellowish fluid was aspirated from the joint and cultured (). A three phase bone scan () performed on the 6th hospital day for the differential diagnosis of tumor metastasis and infection showed a limited region of uptake on the right elbow, suggesting the possibility of arthritis.
The symptoms and signs of arthritis aggravated despite a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. On the 11th hospital day, cultures of synovial fluid and tissue demonstrated the presence of C. tropicalis. However, blood and urine culture specimens were negative. Follow-up right upper elbow ultrasonography on the 11th hospital day showed elbow articular space effusion and hypertrophic synovium. Emergent decompression was performed on the same day, and a drain tube was placed in the right elbow articular space. During the operation, 2 mL of a yellowish-red turbid synovial fluid sample was obtained and submitted for culture, which later confirmed the presence of C. tropicalis. In addition, abdominal computed tomography on the same day showed no evidence of hepato-splenic candidiasis.
Intraveneous itraconazole 400 mg/day (5 mg/kg/day) was started on the 11th and 12th days. Intravenous itraconazole was decreased to 200 mg/day on the 13th day and then kept at the same dose. Fever, joint swelling, and arthralgia gradually resolved after itraconazole treatment, and after 2 weeks of intravenous itraconazole treatment on the 25th hospital day. Intravenous itraconazole 200 mg/day was substituted for oral itraconazole solution at 200 mg/day.
The antifungal treatment was maintained for three months, and from 14 days after treatment commencement the patient had no elbow pain and was without disability. Furthermore, no relapse of the fungal arthritis occurred during oral itraconazole therapy. Simple radiography and a bone scan carried out after 3 months of antifungal treatment showed no abnormal lesion related to septic arthritis, and oral itraconazole was discontinued.

 Here is the patient note:
A 58-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of stage IV colon cancer being treated actively with FOLFOX and bevacizumab presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaint of left-sided chest pain and left shoulder pain which started over a year ago but acutely increased in intensity and frequency over the past three weeks. The pain was inconsistently worse with position, associated with dyspnea, left-sided neck pain, and belching, without fever, chills, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysphagia, melena, or hematochezia. Her last chemotherapy treatment was five days prior. She was initially diagnosed with the cancer 2.5 years ago with metastasis to the liver and was treated initially with diverting colostomy and chemotherapy with bevacizumab, later modified to include FOLFOX. The patient denied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use or alcohol or illicit drug abuse.
In the ED, initial vital signs showed blood pressure 174/83 mmHg, heart rate 101/minute, respiratory rate 24/minute, SpO2 97% on room air, temperature 96.9°F. Physical examination was unremarkable except for decreased breath sounds and regular tachycardia. Labs showed hemoglobin (16 g/dL), alkaline phosphatase (299 U/L), and negative urine drug screen. Serial troponins six hours apart were negative, and initial ECG showed sinus rhythm without ischemic changes. Thoracic CT angiogram ruled out pulmonary embolism and showed pneumopericardium, gastropericardial fistula, and three liver lesions suspicious for metastatic disease, as shown in .
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 55-60%, no valvular disease, and a normal pulmonary pressure and suggested the presence of pericardial air due to significant acoustic attenuation in otherwise previously normal windows. A barium swallow was performed with no visible esophageal stricture or ulceration, but the field of view did not include the stomach.
An EGD was done and showed a normal esophagus and 3 cm penetrating gastric cardia ulcer with surrounding edema and nonbleeding vessel in the center; biopsy was negative for dysplasia, metaplasia, malignancy, or H. pylori.
Surgical intervention was performed by cardiothoracic and general surgery teams, including median sternotomy, laparotomy, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to delineate the area of ulceration, posterior pericardial debridement of tissue adhesions, gastric ulcer resection and primary repair with omental patch, gastrojejunostomy feeding tube insertion, diaphragmatic patch with mesh, pericardial washout, and pericardial/pleural chest tube placement. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and placed on total parenteral nutrition. After a few days, she was discharged home without any postoperative complications.

To calculate the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, we need to evaluate the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient presented with left-sided chest pain and left shoulder pain, which is a possible symptom of Pulmonary Embolism. However, the patient also had a past medical history of stage IV colon cancer and was being treated with chemotherapy, which could also cause chest pain. The patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate, were within normal limits. The patient's physical examination was unremarkable except for decreased breath sounds and regular tachycardia, which could be related to the patient's underlying medical condition. The patient's lab results, including hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and urine drug screen, were normal. The patient's ECG showed sinus rhythm without ischemic changes, and the thoracic CT angiogram ruled out pulmonary embolism. Therefore, we can conclude that the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism is 0.

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department with pain and swelling of his right leg for the past 2 days. Three days ago he collapsed on his leg after tripping on a rug. It was a hard fall and left him with bruising of his leg. Since then the pain and swelling of his leg have been gradually increasing. Past medical history is noncontributory. He lives a rather sedentary life and smokes two packs of cigarettes per day. The vital signs include heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 15/min, temperature 37.8°C (100.1°F), and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, his right leg is visibly swollen up to the mid-calf with pitting edema and moderate erythema. Peripheral pulses in the right leg are weak and the leg is tender. Manipulation of the right leg is negative for Homan’s sign.

 Here is the patient note:
An 80-year-old italian woman of Caucasian origin presented to the emergency room at the Catholic University of Rome with severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Her symptoms, which had developed over the last four months, consisted of unrelenting lower abdominal pain that began 30 minutes after eating and lasted for about three hours. It was unrelieved by bowel movements or changes in position. For this reason, the patient reduced her food intake, and her weight decreased by 5 kg. The day before admission, bloody diarrhea developed.
The patient had a history of arterial hypertension, hiatal hernia, bilateral hearing loss due to chronic otomastoiditis, and polyarthritis (cervical, dorsal, and lumbosacral spondylosis; bilateral osteoarthritis of the hip). She had undergone open surgical cholecystectomy for gallstones in 1959. In 1998, she was hospitalized for rectal bleeding caused by acute diverticulitis. In 2004, she was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the papilla of Vater and had a cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy. The pathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated intestinal-type adenocarcinoma measuring 1.5 cm in diameter that had invaded the muscle layers of the duodenal wall. The margins were tumor-free, and two lymph nodes were negative for malignancy. During that hospitalization, she developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that was converted to a normal sinus rhythm with amiodarone. Her medications included zofenopril (7.5 mg/day), manidipine (10 mg/day), esomeprazole 20 mg/day, celecoxib (400-600 mg/day), and acetaminophen plus codeine (500 mg plus 30 mg/day). She had no known drug allergies.
During admission, she was alert and oriented with normal vital signs (blood pressure, 150/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 80 beats per minute; temperature, 36.8°C). The lower abdomen was tender, but there were no signs of peritonitis. Although the bowel sounds were decreased, passage of flatus and feces was normal. There was no palpable organomegaly. The patient's lungs were clear on auscultation and a systolic ejection murmur (2/6) was heard over her aortic area. Admission laboratory tests revealed: hemoglobin 12.1 g/dl; white-cell count 15,290/mm3 (neutrophils 86%); platelet count 317,000/mm3; total protein 5.6 g/dl; albumin 3.2 g/dl. Serum electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, and amylase levels were within normal limits, as were the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time. Plain films of the abdomen revealed no free intraperitoneal air or air-fluid levels, and the chest x-ray excluded the presence of pneumonia or nodules. Immediately after admission she was placed on an NPO (nil per os) regimen with total parenteral nutrition, and within eight hours her symptoms completely disappeared.
Abdominal CT (Figure ) revealed a hypodense mass measuring 4 × 4 cm in the space between the vena cava and the aorta, at the level of the origin of the celiac trunk. The mass extended caudally for about 4 cm, enveloping the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, the left renal vein at its confluence into the inferior vena cava, and the origin of the right renal artery, and anteriorly to the confluence of the splenic and mesenteric veins. Enlarged lymph nodes (1 cm) were observed at the hepatic hilum and in the intercavoaortic and left para-aortic spaces. Thickened bowel loops were also seen. This picture was consistent with local recurrence of the neoplastic disease.
A week later, oral feedings were resumed and the patient once again experienced diffuse abdominal pain and diarrhea. The pain responded poorly to conventional analgesics (scopolamine 20 mg IV, acetaminophen 500 mg PO, tramadol 37.5 mg PO t.i.d., fentanyl 25 μg transdermally), but it disappeared promptly when oral feedings were withdrawn.
A duplex ultrasound examination was performed to assess the mesenteric circulation (Figure and Figure ). To the extent that it could be explored, the artery showed no evident stenoses on B-mode or color- and power-Doppler evaluation. The superior mesenteric artery was characterized by a high peak systolic velocity (283 cm/sec) that was consistent with vascular stenosis. Blood flow in the celiac artery was turbulent, and the peak systolic velocity was also high (118 cm/sec). The patient was started on subcutaneous enoxaparin (4000 U/day) and transdermal nitroglycerin (10 mg/day, from 08.00 to 20.00). Since oral feedings could not be resumed, a central venous catheter was inserted for prolonged parenteral nutrition.
In view of the tumor histotype and the age and general condition of the patient, there was no indication for systemic chemotherapy and the patient was transferred to a hospice. She remained pain-free without any form of analgesics and had a relatively good quality of life until her death three months later.

She had no known drug allergies.\nDuring admission, she was alert and oriented with normal vital signs (blood pressure, 150/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 80 beats per minute; temperature, 36.8°C). The lower abdomen was tender, but there were no signs of peritonitis. Although the bowel sounds were decreased, passage of flatus and feces was normal. There was no palpable organomegaly. The patient's lungs were clear on auscultation and a systolic ejection murmur (2/6) was heard over her aortic area. Admission laboratory tests revealed: hemoglobin 12.1 g/dl; white-cell count 15,290/mm3 (neutrophils 86%); platelet count 317,000/mm3; total protein 5.6 g/dl; albumin 3.2 g/dl. Serum electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, and amylase levels were within normal limits, as were the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time. Plain films of the abdomen revealed no free intraperitoneal air or air-fluid levels, and the chest x-ray excluded the presence of pneumonia or nodules. Immediately after admission she was placed on an NPO (nil per os) regimen with total parenteral nutrition, and within eight hours her symptoms completely disappeared.\nAbdominal CT (Figure ) revealed a hypodense mass measuring 4 × 4 cm in the space between the vena cava and the aorta, at the level of the origin of the celiac trunk. The mass extended caudally for about 4 cm, enveloping the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, the left renal vein at its confluence into the inferior vena cava, and the origin of the right renal artery, and anteriorly to the confluence of the splenic and mesenteric veins. Enlarged lymph nodes (1 cm) were observed at the hepatic hilum and in the intercavoaortic and left para-aortic spaces. Thickened bowel loops were also seen. This picture was consistent with local recurrence of the neoplastic disease.\nA week later, oral feedings were resumed and the patient once again experienced diffuse abdominal pain and diarrhea. The pain responded poorly to conventional analgesics (scopolamine 20 mg IV, acetaminophen 500 mg PO, tramadol 37.5 mg PO t.i.d., fentanyl 25 μg transdermally), but it disappeared promptly when oral feedings were withdrawn.\nA duplex ultrasound examination was performed to assess the mesenteric circulation (Figure and Figure ). To the extent that it could be explored, the artery showed no evident stenoses on B-mode or color- and power-Doppler evaluation. The superior mesenteric artery was characterized by a high peak systolic velocity (283 cm/sec) that was consistent with vascular stenosis. Blood flow in the celiac artery was turbulent, and the peak systolic velocity was also high (118 cm/sec). The patient was started on subcutaneous enoxaparin (4000 U/day) and transdermal nitroglycerin (10 mg/day, from 08.00 to 20.00). Since oral feedings could not be resumed, a central venous catheter was inserted for prolonged parenteral nutrition.\nIn view of the tumor histotype and the age and general condition of the patient, there was no indication for systemic chemotherapy and the patient was transferred to a hospice.

 Here is the patient note:
We report a case of 49-years-old male who received a kidney from a live unrelated donor since 7 years ago. During these seven years multiple low grade fevers was being appeared every year that healed without a diagnosis. On 29 May 2013, he presented with 39 °C fever associated with dysuria, oliguria, right lower quadrant abdominal pain, anorexia, cough and dyspnea. The patient had also history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and gout. Blood pressure measured 130/90 mmHg, pulse rate 96 per minute, and respiratory rate 18 per minute. Laboratory tests were as follow: BUN= 19 mg/dl, Cr= 2 mg/dl, Na= 133 mEq/l, K=4.5 mEq/l, FBS=130 mg/dl, ESR= 50 mm/hour, CRP= 44.1 mg/dl, WBC= 5.8 ×106/µL, RBC= 4.02 × 106/µL, Hg= 11.3 g/dl, hematocrit= 33.6%, MCV 83.58 fl, and platelet= 171 × 106/µL. In sonography investigation, his kidney graft was 123×55 mm with normal parenchymal echo. The test for cytomegalovirus (CMV Ag-pp65) was negative and enterobacter growth was seen in the blood culture. In high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), an increase in heart size, mediastinum vascular swelling, reticular densities, septal thickness, bronchial wall thickness, mild bronchiectasis, patchy and nodular alveolar densities on the inferior lobe of both lungs were seen. Spiral CT scan showed micro-consolidation patchy lesions on the inferior lobe of both lungs (). Bronchoscopy showed hyper-vascularity in the trachea, and in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) growth of non-A, non-D streptococci were detected with no growth of acid fast bacilli or mycobacterium tuberculosis. After 17 days of antibiotic and antifungal therapy, his fever did not corrupt. Spirometry results, showed a decreased FEV1 to 75%. On June 23th, inferior lobe wedge resection of the left lung was performed. In macroscopic pathologic examinations, fragments of lung tissue measuring 5×2×2 cm and gray brown and soft tissue in serial cross sections were observed.Moreover, microscopic evaluations conducted on issue removed during a procedure (). Finally, the diagnosis of BOOP was reported with no evidence of malignancy. Sirolimus was withdrawn and cyclosporine was started and dosage of prednisolone was increased. His fever was discontinued and general condition as well as pulmonary symptoms were gradually improved.

 Here is the patient note:
A 41-year-old female patient with a past medical history of bipolar disorder, cocaine use disorder, and tobacco use disorder, presented with increased respiratory distress and combativeness. On initial examination, her vital signs included a temperature of 100.9°F, heart rate of 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and blood pressure of 103/66 mmHg. On physical examination, she was only able to speak in two-word sentences. There were bilateral coarse crackles all over the chest. She did not have any focal neurological deficits. Cardiovascular examination did not reveal abnormal heart sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was immediately placed on a nonrebreather mask. However, the patient kept taking off her nonrebreather mask, continued to have worsening hypoxia, and eventually required tracheal intubation. Chest radiograph showed right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure ).
She was started on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was chosen due to patient's critical condition and unclear etiology of the infecting pathogen. The patient had a white cell count of 11.8 x 103/microliter (µL) that trended to 2.2 x 103/µL, normal troponins, and a lactic acid of 1.8 mmol/Liter (L) initially that trended up to 2.5 mmol/L. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, benzodiazepine, and opiates. Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were negative. Influenza A was positive on rapid antigen testing and the patient was started on oseltamivir. This raised our concern for secondary bacterial pneumonia from MRSA as a complication of influenza virus infection. The patient had computed tomography (CT) of the chest that showed right upper, middle, and lower lobe consolidations with cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma (Figures , ).
Sputum culture and blood cultures grew MRSA that was sensitive to both vancomycin and clindamycin, confirming our diagnosis. Vancomycin had already been started on admission and was continued. Fluid resuscitation was also done early in the course, but eventually progressed to septic shock. The patient was then started on norepinephrine infusion and vasopressin infusion for blood pressure support. She then developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her hypoxia became refractory to conventional ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was considered. She had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 5%. Her cardiomyopathy was felt to be acute and related to sepsis. She was managed for septic and cardiogenic shock, and venous-arterial ECMO was started. She was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for hypervolemia refractory to diuresis, inotropic and vasopressor support. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) five days later showed that the EF recovered to 45%. She continued to remain intubated for 16 days and a repeat CT chest showed worsening and multiple cavitary lesions in the right lung (Figures , ).
A repeat TTE showed EF of 60% and normal left and right heart function. ECMO was stopped and she was decannulated on day 9, CRRT was stopped on day 9. Unfortunately, she did not tolerate withdrawal of ECMO and continued to deteriorate and became difficult to wean from the ventilator. Given her lack of response to vancomycin, she was switched to daptomycin and linezolid, and the vancomycin was discontinued. She did not improve with new antibiotic regimen, continued to accumulate volume, and could not tolerate being off CRRT that was resumed for volume removal. Her hypoxia continued to be refractory despite all efforts. The family eventually decided to transition to comfort care due to her poor prognosis.

On physical examination, she was only able to speak in two-word sentences. There were bilateral coarse crackles all over the chest. She did not have any focal neurological deficits. Cardiovascular examination did not reveal abnormal heart sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was immediately placed on a nonrebreather mask. However, the patient kept taking off her nonrebreather mask, continued to have worsening hypoxia, and eventually required tracheal intubation. Chest radiograph showed right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure ).\nShe was started on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was chosen due to patient's critical condition and unclear etiology of the infecting pathogen. The patient had a white cell count of 11.8 x 103/microliter (µL) that trended to 2.2 x 103/µL, normal troponins, and a lactic acid of 1.8 mmol/Liter (L) initially that trended up to 2.5 mmol/L. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, benzodiazepine, and opiates. Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were negative. Influenza A was positive on rapid antigen testing and the patient was started on oseltamivir. This raised our concern for secondary bacterial pneumonia from MRSA as a complication of influenza virus infection. The patient had computed tomography (CT) of the chest that showed right upper, middle, and lower lobe consolidations with cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma (Figures , ).\nSputum culture and blood cultures grew MRSA that was sensitive to both vancomycin and clindamycin, confirming our diagnosis. Vancomycin had already been started on admission and was continued. Fluid resuscitation was also done early in the course, but eventually progressed to septic shock. The patient was then started on norepinephrine infusion and vasopressin infusion for blood pressure support. She then developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her hypoxia became refractory to conventional ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was considered. She had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 5%. Her cardiomyopathy was felt to be acute and related to sepsis. She was managed for septic and cardiogenic shock, and venous-arterial ECMO was started. She was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for hypervolemia refractory to diuresis, inotropic and vasopressor support. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) five days later showed that the EF recovered to 45%. She continued to remain intubated for 16 days and a repeat CT chest showed worsening and multiple cavitary lesions in the right lung (Figures , ).\nA repeat TTE showed EF of 60% and normal left and right heart function. ECMO was stopped and she was decannulated on day 9, CRRT was stopped on day 9. Unfortunately, she did not tolerate withdrawal of ECMO and continued to deteriorate and became difficult to wean from the ventilator. Given her lack of response to vancomycin, she was switched to daptomycin and linezolid, and the vancomycin was discontinued. She did not improve with new antibiotic regimen, continued to accumulate volume, and could not tolerate being off CRRT that was resumed for volume removal. Her hypoxia continued to be refractory despite all efforts. The family eventually decided to transition to comfort care due to her poor prognosis.", 'Question': "What is the patient’s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", 'LLM Answer': '0', 'LLM Explanation': "The patient note does not mention any symptoms or signs that are typically associated with pulmonary embolism, such as sudden onset of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, or hemoptysis.

 Here is the patient note:
A 62-year-old man was admitted with a 5-day history of fever, increased urinary frequency, and left flank pain. He had no specific medical or surgical history, except for a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes treated with insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, temperature of 38.4℃, heart rate of 76 beats/min, and respiration rate of 20 breaths/min. His breathing sound was clear, and his heartbeat was regular without murmurs. However, knocking tenderness in his left flank area was noted. The initial laboratory data revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14,680/mm3, hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL, platelet count of 373,000/mm3, CRP level of >12 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c level of 12.5%, indicating that his diabetes was poorly controlled. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase levels were within the normal range. Urinalysis showed white and red blood cell counts of 3–5/high-power field (HPF) and 10–15/HPF, respectively. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans showed a multifocal decreased perfusion defect of the left kidney. Blood and urine culture samples were obtained, and intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g/d) was administered immediately. His fever subsided within 72 hours, and laboratory data demonstrated improvement. Five days after admission, the initial urine and blood cultures revealed growth of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Urologic evaluation regarding bladder obstruction and screening for metastatic infection were recommended. However, the patient declined further evaluation, as his discomfort had subsided, and his poor socioeconomic status impeded the payment of additional medical costs. Eight days after admission, laboratory data demonstrated further improvement (WBC count, 8,760/mm3; CRP level, 1.95 mg/dL). Follow-up urine and blood cultures obtained on day 5 revealed no bacterial growth. The patient was therefore discharged with oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours) for 7 days. He was asked to attend the outpatient clinic for 1 month to receive maintenance ciprofloxacin, but he failed to attend.
Approximately 1 month later, the patient presented with a 7-day history of symptoms consistent with those at his initial visit. His vital signs were as follows: a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, temperature of 38.4℃, heart rate of 115 beats/min, and respiration rate of 20 breaths/min. Bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness was noted. Laboratory data revealed a WBC count of 15,870/mm3, hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 375,000/mm3, and CRP level of >12 mg/dL. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase levels were within the normal range. Urinalysis showed a WBC count of 30–50/HPF with many bacteria and a red blood cell count of 5–10/HPF. A CT scan showed a multifocal decreased perfusion defect of both kidneys () with bladder distension. Urologic evaluation demonstrated a residual urine volume of 250 mL. Prostate-specific antigen levels were normal. He was therefore diagnosed with recurrent pyelonephritis and neurogenic bladder. An oral alpha blocking agent and intravenous ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 12 hours) were administered. Two days after readmission, his left lower flank pain persisted, despite a fentanyl patch (12 µg/h). Although there were no neurologic deficits, a neurosurgeon was consulted regarding his severe pain and the possibility of concomitant spinal disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium enhancement was performed, revealing epidural abscesses at L4–5 and paraspinal abscesses of the muscles at L3–S2 (). Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the paraspinal muscle layer was performed using an 18-gauge needle, and approximately 10 mL of yellow-white mucoid fluid was aspirated. The epidural abscesses were not drained, as there were no neurologic deficits. Cultures of blood and drained fluid revealed MSSA growth () with antimicrobial sensitivity identical to that of the initial culture. Urine cultures revealed growth of <1,000 colony forming units/mL, although the bacterial strain could not be identified. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed no evidence of infective endocarditis. Nafcillin was injected every 4 hours for 22 days. However, neutropenia occurred, and nafcillin was replaced with vancomycin for an additional 30 days. On day 57 after readmission, MRI showed the abscesses had decreased in size (). Residual urine volume was 40 mL, and no discomfort was observed. Laboratory data were nearly within the normal range (WBC count, 6,490/mm3; CRP level, 0.35 mg/dL). On day 59, he was discharged without neurologic sequelae and was prescribed ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours) until a repeat MRI showed no remnant abscesses.

 Here is the patient note:
A 48-year-old woman presents with a 15-year history of long, painful menses that is only partially relieved with oral contraceptives. She desires definitive treatment. She denies weight loss or post-coital bleeding, and her husband has been her only sexual partner. She does not have a history of smoking, alcohol or illicit drug use, or sexually transmitted diseases. She sees her gynecologist annually. She takes no medications. An abdominal ultrasound shows a non-gravid uterus with hyperechoic islands and an irregular endometrial-myometrial junction, consistent with adenomyosis. A supracervical hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy are performed without incident. Later that day, the patient’s vitals are stable: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 15/min, blood pressure 100/75 mm Hg, breathing 100% oxygen on room air. The patient is not in acute distress with a Foley catheter in place. The physical exam is unremarkable. However, she has only excreted a minimal amount of urine output in the past several hours after surgery. Only 10cc or urine is produced over the next 12 hours. A bladder scan shows minimal residual urine. CBC, CMP, and urinalysis are ordered, and renal ultrasound is shown in the picture.

 Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.
Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.
The patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations.

 Here is the patient note:
A 59-year-old woman attended her General Practitioner (GP) with a 3-week history of lethargy, myalgia, pyrexia and night sweats. She had no significant past medical history and was not on any regular medications. Her most recent travel had been to Spain a few months previously, and she lived at home with her husband and dog, who were in good health. Her GP performed some blood tests, shown in , which prompted urgent referral for admission to hospital due to the notably raised white cell count and CRP.
In the Emergency Department the patient was pyrexic with a temperature of 39.4 °C. Otherwise, her observations were normal. She had no audible murmurs and the rest of her examination was unremarkable.
Chest X-ray was normal and ECG showed sinus rhythm with a rate of 76 beats per minute and first-degree AV block. One set of blood cultures and urine cultures were sent and she was started on IV piperacillin/tazobactam for pyrexia of unknown origin. She was tested for influenza by PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab, which was negative.
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), carried out on day 2 of admission, demonstrated a mass on the aortic valve, which was further characterized by trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TOE), identifying a 1.8×0.9 cm mass with thickening of the aortic root, suspicious for root abscess.
On day 2 of admission, when the TTE raised the suspicion of endocarditis, she had seven further sets of blood cultures sent over a period of 72 h and was changed to IV amoxicillin 2 g 4 hourly, and gentamicin 3 mg kg−1 OD, as empirical treatment for native valve infective endocarditis.
She was transferred to cardiac surgery on day 4 of admission and underwent aortic valve replacement surgery (). Procedure note from Cardiothoracics as follows: ‘Via oblique aortotomy, tri-leaflet valve was seen with a huge vegetation and perforation at the annulus. There was a small abscess cavity in the annulus at the non-coronary cusp. The native valve was excised, and the cavity was debrided easily, with rifampicin washout. A size 21 Inspiris Reslia bioprosthetic valve was implanted in annular position with 15× Ethibond 2/0 interrupted technique (5 Teflon pledgeted at the Non coronary cusp area). Aorta closed in single layer, using Haemoseal pledgeted sutures. De-aired. Cross-clamp off. Right Ventricular pacing wire inserted and checked. Weaned off Cardio-Pulmonary Bypass. Good valve function with no paravalvular leak and adequate de-airing confirmed on Trans-oesophageal ECHO. Mediastinal and pericardial drains inserted. Protamine given, haemostasis checked/effected.’
The valve was sent by the cardiac surgeons to the microbiology laboratory for culture, and sent away for 16s PCR testing. It was not sent to histopathology.
On day 5 of admission, the aerobic bottle of the first set of blood cultures taken flagged positive after being incubated in Bact T/Alert 3-D (bioMérieux, France) for 3.5 days. Gram-negative rods were observed on Gram stain (). Given this information, the patient’s antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone, vancomycin and gentamicin, whilst waiting for culture and identification of this organism. Subculture on Columbia blood agar yielded fine smooth, creamy white and non-haemolytic colonies. Species identification was performed using Vitek MS [matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)], which confirmed the organism as C. carnimorsus. As there were no recommended European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) antibiotic breakpoints, E-test strips were set up and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured against EUCAST PK-PD (non-species-related) breakpoints. This organism was susceptible to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, penicillin, ciprofloxacin and meropenem. The remaining sets of blood cultures were all negative after 5 days of incubation.
Given the identification of this organism, the patient’s antibiotic therapy was changed to Meropenem, Vancomycin and Gentamicin pending susceptibility testing. The heart valve was cultured and was negative after 7 days of incubation in enrichment broth. The valve was also sent to the Public Health England reference laboratory for 16S rDNA real-time PCR identification. Report: this identified species, with data indicating a 99 % sequence homology to C. cynodegmi, C. canimorsus and C. stomatis, providing robust evidence to confirm the responsible pathogen. The patient’s treatment was, therefore, targeted towards C. canimorusus, based on the antibiotic susceptibility test results () obtained through E-test, which were interpreted using EUCAST non-species-specific PK-PD breakpoints. Her antibiotic therapy was changed to IV benzylpenicillin, to complete 4 weeks of treatment.
The patient improved clinically and was discharged home after completion of treatment and a repeat ECHO prior to discharge showed normal left ventricular function and prosthetic aortic valve, with a repeat ECHO and follow-up planned in 1 year.

The patient note does not mention any symptoms or signs suggestive of pulmonary embolism. The patient was admitted with a 3-week history of lethargy, myalgia, pyrexia, and night sweats, which are not typical symptoms of pulmonary embolism. The patient's blood tests showed a raised white cell count and CRP, which is more consistent with an infectious process. The patient's chest X-ray was normal, and there is no mention of any respiratory symptoms or signs. Therefore, it is unlikely that the patient has pulmonary embolism. The Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism are not applicable in this case.
{'Row Number': 138, 'Calculator Name': "Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism", 'Calculator ID': '8', 'Category': 'risk', 'Note ID': 'pmc-8209631-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 59-year-old woman attended her General Practitioner (GP) with a 3-week history of lethargy, myalgia, pyrexia and night sweats. She had no significant past medical history and was not on any regular medications. Her most recent travel had been to Spain a few months previously, and she lived at home with her husband and dog, who were in good health. Her GP performed some blood tests, shown in , which prompted urgent referral for admission to hospital due to the notably raised white cell count and CRP.\nIn the Emergency Department the patient was pyrexic with a temperature of 39.4 °C. Otherwise, her observations were normal. She had no audible murmurs and the rest of her examination was unremarkable.\nChest X-ray was normal and ECG showed sinus rhythm with a rate of 76 beats per minute and first-degree AV block. One set of blood cultures and urine cultures were sent and she was started on IV piperacillin/tazobactam for pyrexia of unknown origin. She was tested for influenza by PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab, which was negative.\nTransthoracic echocardiography (TTE), carried out on day 2 of admission, demonstrated a mass on the aortic valve, which was further characterized by trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TOE), identifying a 1.8×0.9 cm mass with thickening of the aortic root, suspicious for root abscess.\nOn day 2 of admission, when the TTE raised the suspicion of endocarditis, she had seven further sets of blood cultures sent over a period of 72 h and was changed to IV amoxicillin 2 g 4 hourly, and gentamicin 3 mg kg−1 OD, as empirical treatment for native valve infective endocarditis.\nShe was transferred to cardiac surgery on day 4 of admission and underwent aortic valve replacement surgery (). Procedure note from Cardiothoracics as follows: ‘Via oblique aortotomy, tri-leaflet valve was seen with a huge vegetation and perforation at the annulus. There was a small abscess cavity in the annulus at the non-coronary cusp. The native valve was excised, and the cavity was debrided easily, with rifampicin washout. A size 21 Inspiris Reslia bioprosthetic valve was implanted in annular position with 15× Ethibond 2/0 interrupted technique (5 Teflon pledgeted at the Non coronary cusp area). Aorta closed in single layer, using Haemoseal pledgeted sutures. De-aired. Cross-clamp off. Right Ventricular pacing wire inserted and checked. Weaned off Cardio-Pulmonary Bypass. Good valve function with no paravalvular leak and adequate de-airing confirmed on Trans-oesophageal ECHO. Mediastinal and pericardial drains inserted. Protamine given, haemostasis checked/effected.’\nThe valve was sent by the cardiac surgeons to the microbiology laboratory for culture, and sent away for 16s PCR testing. It was not sent to histopathology.\nOn day 5 of admission, the aerobic bottle of the first set of blood cultures taken flagged positive after being incubated in Bact T/Alert 3-D (bioMérieux, France) for 3.5 days. Gram-negative rods were observed on Gram stain (). Given this information, the patient’s antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone, vancomycin and gentamicin, whilst waiting for culture and identification of this organism. Subculture on Columbia blood agar yielded fine smooth, creamy white and non-haemolytic colonies. Species identification was performed using Vitek MS [matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)], which confirmed the organism as C. carnimorsus. As there were no recommended European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) antibiotic breakpoints, E-test strips were set up and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured against EUCAST PK-PD (non-species-related) breakpoints. This organism was susceptible to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, penicillin, ciprofloxacin and meropenem. The remaining sets of blood cultures were all negative after 5 days of incubation.\nGiven the identification of this organism, the patient’s antibiotic therapy was changed to Meropenem, Vancomycin and Gentamicin pending susceptibility testing. The heart valve was cultured and was negative after 7 days of incubation in enrichment broth. The valve was also sent to the Public Health England reference laboratory for 16S rDNA real-time PCR identification.

 Here is the patient note:
An 80-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus non-compliant to the prescribed medications, presented to the emergency department with 1-hour complaint of right-sided chest pain that was described as aching, non-radiating, without any aggravating or relieving factors, 10/10 in intensity, and was accompanied by nausea and two episodes of maroon-colored emesis. The patient denied any ingestion of toxic substances and any prior similar episodes. On presentation, the patient was afebrile, and blood pressure of 109/45, heart rate 75, respiratory rate of 18, and room air oximetry of 98%. Physical examination, including fundoscopy was unrevealing. Labs workup revealed serum sodium of 125 mEq/L [135-145 mEq/L], potassium 5.1 mEq/L [3.5-5.0 mEq/L], chloride 91 mEq/L [98-107 mEq/L], bicarbonate 24 mEq/L [21-24 mEq/L], urea 145,7 mg/dL [14.9 – 51.4 mg/dL], creatinine 2.95 mg/dL [0.6-1.30 mg/dL], blood glucose 492 mg/dL [70-110], WBC 13.5 [4.5-11.0 × 103/mm3], Hb 12.3 g/dL [13.5-17.5 g/dL], platelets 242,000/mm3 [140k-440k/mm3], BNP 154 pg/mL [125-450 pg/mL], and troponin 0.062 ng/mL [0.01-0.30 ng/mL]. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 94 beats per minute without ST or T-wave abnormalities. Morphine was administered along with nitroglycerine for the chest pain without any improvement in symptoms. Therefore, given the persistent chest pain and concern for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, the patient was started on a heparin drip and antiplatelet therapy in the emergency department. Cardiology was consulted who performed a cardiac catheterization which did not show any critical stenosis with an estimated ejection fraction of 55%. They recommended medical therapy including anti-hypertensives, statin, and blood glucose control. The computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast was unremarkable. Gastroenterology was then consulted due to abdominal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and hematemesis. Patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which showed circumferential, black-appearing, necrotic esophageal mucosa without active bleeding extending from the mid to distal esophagus (). There was also mild chronic gastritis without any evidence of active bleeding. The patient was treated with a proton pump inhibitor and sucralfate. Patient had an uneventful hospital course lasting 5 days and was discharged with close follow up.

 Here is the patient note:
A 51-year-old man was referred to our tertiary Department of Nephrology from a regional hospital, due to acute renal failure (ARF) following a severe lung infection. His recent medical history started 15 days ago, at the beginning of January, when he presented to the emergency room (ER) of the regional hospital with fever (up to 40°C), chills, and productive cough for three days prior to his admission. He had no history of chronic diseases or drug abuse. His kidney function was normal (serum creatinine 0.95 mg/dL) a year before. He was a smoker and he worked as a cook in a local hotel from April to October each year.
At presentation to the ER he was febrile (39.2°C), blood pressure (BP) was 135/79 mmHg, and pulse was 76 beats per minute. His oxygen saturation was 91.6% in room air, with blood gas showing pH = 7.53, pO2 = 55 mmHg, pCO2 = 32 mmHg, and FiO2 = 21%. Auscultation of the chest revealed diffuse bilateral crackles. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. A chest radiograph showed bilateral lower lung infiltrates and a computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse bilateral opacities in the lower lobes ().
Laboratory tests on admission showed normal white blood cells (4230/mm3, 89% neutrophils, 7% lymphocytes, and 1.7% monocytes), hematocrit at 33.3%, hyponatremia (Na 128 mmol/L), markedly elevated C-reactive protein levels (60 mg/dL), and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (90 mm/min). The rest of his work-up showed serum creatinine 1.23 mg/dL, blood urea 57 mg/dL, AST 80 IU, ALT 44 IU, CPK 523 IU/L, and LDH 402 IU/L (). Urinalysis showed 2+ proteinuria, while sediment showed 1-2 erythrocytes and 1-2 leukocytes per high-power field. The patients' blood cultures, viral serologies (EBV, CMV, HCV, HBV, and HIV), and skin test for tuberculosis (PPD test) were negative.
The patient was started on combined antibiotic treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam, moxifloxacin, and oseltamivir with considerable improvement of his fever, respiratory symptoms, signs, and radiological findings over the next few days. However, his renal function gradually declined with serum creatinine increasing to 2.52 mg/dL and blood urea to 91 mg/dL at Day 3. Due to the combined pulmonary and renal disease the suspicion of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) due to systemic vasculitis was hypothesized and pulse steroid treatment at a dose of 500 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone daily was initiated at Day 4, and the patient was referred to our department at Day 8, for further evaluation and treatment.
At presentation in our department, the patient was afebrile, BP was at 158/80 mmHg, pulse was 71 beats per minute, respiratory rate was at 25 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation was 94% in room air. Blood gas showed pH = 7.35, pO2 = 80.5 mmHg, pCO2 = 20.7 mmHg, HCO3 = 11.1 mmol/L, ABE = −13.1 mmol/L, and sO2 = 94% while auscultation revealed crackles at the lower lobes of his lungs. He had pitting peripheral edema while his urinary output was normal. The rest of the clinical examination was unremarkable. His laboratory testing showed elevated serum creatinine 3.42 mg/dL and urea 165 mg/dL. However, urine analysis was once again normal (1-2 erythrocytes and 0–2 leukocytes, no casts, and no abnormal erythrocytes) and proteinuria was at 800 mg/24 h. A renal ultrasound showed slightly enlarged kidneys (right, 11.5 cm and left, 12.4 cm) with increased width of cortex (1.5 cm and 2.6 cm). Although the diagnosis of pulmonary and renal failure were evident, due to the absence of nephritic syndrome and the very short period of renal function decline, the diagnosis of RPGN and, therefore, Goodpasture syndrome of any cause could not be supported. Further, the patient had no clinical or radiology signs of lung haemorrhage. At this point the differential diagnosis for his acute kidney injury (AKI) included prerenal AKI due to decrease in renal blood supply at his previous hospitalization (not supported by the referral letter information) and renal AKI due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) induced by drug agents or AIN caused by drugs or microbial agents. For these reasons the pulse methylprednisolone treatment was stopped when 3 gr in total was reached and followed by oral methylprednisolone at a dose of 48 mg daily with fast tapering. Piperacillin-tazobactam was stopped at Day 9 as it is an agent that could cause ATN or AIN. The patient was supported with conservative measures (including diuretics), with respiratory symptoms, signs, and BP normalizing over the next 2-3 days and his peripheral edema gradually resolving. Over the next days serum immunology testing (IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM, rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, serum protein electrophoresis, and immunoglobulin-free κ/λ chains) was negative, confirming the differential diagnosis.
With the patient at stable condition, renal function slightly improved but reached a plateau between Day 10 and Day 12 (serum creatinine 3.52, urea 188 mg/dL). On this basis, moxifloxacin was also interrupted at Day 13, as it could also be a causative factor for AIN, and an ultrasound guided biopsy was performed to diagnose AKI of renal origin at Day 15. Light microscopy showed evidence of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with interstitial edema and inflammatory peritubular infiltrations composed mainly of lymphocytes. The glomeruli had evidence of nonspecific mild mesangial enlargement, with no abnormalities of the glomerular basement membrane (). Immunofluorescence showed no evidence of immune deposits. On this basis further testing for Hantaan virus and Legionella pneumophila antigen was ordered, while a more detailed record of the patient's history revealed that the patient had recently worked for two nights as a cook in his hotel, which opened only for a weekend over the holiday season. On this basis, the diagnosis of AIN due to Legionella pneumophila was confirmed by a positive antigen test at the urine sample returning at Day 21.
After the biopsy the patient was in a stable condition, with his renal function progressively improving with oral steroid use tapered to a dose of 4 mg per week. He was discharged from our hospital at Day 22 with his serum creatinine at 1.87 mg/dL at 28 mg methylprednisolone daily (). He was closely followed up in the Outpatient Department with serum creatinine at 1.53 mg/dL at 1 month after discharge and returned to normal (0.88 mg/dL) at two months after discharge () with cessation of steroid treatment.

Here is the task:
Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

First, we need to identify the patient's serum creatinine levels at different points in time. From the patient note, we can see that the serum creatinine levels are 0.95 mg/dL, 1.23 mg/dL, 2.52 mg/dL, 3.42 mg/dL, and 1.87 mg/dL. We will use the MDRD GFR equation, which is GFR = 175 x (Scr)^(-1.154) x (age)^(-0.203) x (0.742 if female) x (1.212 if African American), where Scr is the serum creatinine level in mg/dL.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old Indian man underwent 18-FDG PET/CT for evaluation of pyrexia and weight loss of 9 kg in 2 months. His blood examination revealed anemia, leukocytosis, and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patient's serum creatinine was found to be raised (1.9 mg%, normal up to 1.4 mg%). His chest X-ray was normal. He was found to have multiple calculi in left kidney on ultrasonography (USG). USG also demonstrated multiple hypo echoic masses; thinned out parenchyma; and a dilated collecting system suggesting a chronically obstructed kidney. Suspicion of pyelonephritis was raised in the USG report and rest of the abdominal organs were unremarkable. Urinalysis showed pyuria and Escherichia coli was detected in urine culture. Antibiotic therapy was instituted for treatment of the urinary tract infection. Even after extensive antibiotic therapy, the fever remained unresolved and weight loss continued. Before invasive diagnosis, patient was referred for a whole body 18-FDG PET/CT to confirm kidney as the sole site of active disease and rule out any extra-renal pathology as the cause of symptoms.
For PET/CT, 10 mCi of FDG was injected intravenously to patient after 6 h of fasting. After 1 h of injection, patient was scanned on dedicated 16 slice PET – CT (GE – STE 16). Whole body CT scan was obtained as part of PET/CT protocol on a multi-slice CT with 3.5 mm slice thickness without contrast injection. Contrast administration was withheld considering the increased serum creatinine level. Standardized uptake value (SUV) of FDG was normalized to body weight obtained over lesions.
The maximum intensity projection (MIP) image [Figures and , arrows] revealed intense FDG uptake in cortex of grossly enlarged hydronephrotic left kidney. SUV max of uptake was 14.1. Multiple calculi were seen in pelviureteric junction and in pelvi-calyceal system [Figure red arrows]. Extensive perinephric fat stranding and mild FDG uptake in perinephric, retroperitoneal lymph nodes was seen with SUV max of 4.1 [Figure and white arrows]. The findings were reported as possible XGNP. In addition to these findings diffuse FDG uptake was seen in bone marrow [black arrow in ]. This could be due to anemia or the pyrexic state. Left nephrectomy was performed and histopathology confirmed XGNP. Post-nephrectomy, patient's fever resolved and he reported gradual weight gain over last 4 months.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.
The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).
Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.
Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.
The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

Here is the task:
Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old African-American female with a history of end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes and hypertension underwent a cadaveric kidney transplant. The post-operative course was unremarkable with excellent graft function and serum creatinine ranging from 1.4 to 1.7 mg/dL for many years. Immunosuppression was maintained with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone. There were no episodes of rejection or recurrent urinary tract infection. Seven years later, serum creatinine was noted to increase to as high as 3.6 mg/dL over a few days from presentation. There were neither specific complaints nor any localizing physical examination findings. A kidney ultrasound showed a hyperechoic solid mass in the renal medulla, with central compression and resultant hydronephrosis. Follow-up imaging with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed an 11 × 10 × 8.5 cm fatty mass at the center of the transplant kidney, causing compression of the central renal pelvis and dilatation of peripheral calyces (). Mycophenolate mofetil was held for initial suspicion of malignancy and was then restarted once malignancy was ruled out after the medullary mass biopsy.
Due to the obstruction and renal deterioration, a percutaneous nephrostomy was placed with subsequent nephrostogram showing dilatation and distortion of the renal allograft collecting system. After decompression, the patient had an improvement in renal function with serum creatinine decreasing to 1.6 mg/dL ().
A biopsy of both the renal cortex and medullary mass was performed. Renal cortex biopsy showed low-range borderline acute tubulointerstitial rejection with mononuclear infiltrates, extensive arteriolar hyalinosis and moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. There was no evidence of polyoma virus nephropathy. A biopsy of the renal medullary mass revealed mature adipocytes with no evidence of hyperchromasia and increased vascularity (). A dose of methylprednisolone was administered intravenously followed by an oral steroid taper for the acute rejection changes seen in the biopsy. Mycophenolate mofetil was restarted once malignancy was ruled out.

Here is the task:
Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

 Here is the patient note:
A 94-year old woman presented with high fever associated with decreased oral intake and appetite loss and was admitted to our institute. She had been diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus, mild chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure and stayed at a nursing home. She was a wheelchair-user. At the initial presentation, the patient had a body temperature of 40.2 °C, blood pressure of 183/81 mmHg, and pulse of 74 beats per min. Hypoxemia was not confirmed. The physical examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray and urine test were normal. Laboratory tests revealed an elevation of blood urea nitrogen 23.8 mg/dl, creatinine 1.14 mg/dl and C-reactive protein 1.93 mg/dl. Platelet count was low at 105,000/μl. White cell count, hemoglobin and liver function tests were within normal range as shown in supplementary file. Two sets of blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi were drawn. Then, the patient was started empirically on meropenem and teicoplanin for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. In addition to blood cultures, a urinalysis with culture and a chest X-ray and CT were performed and found to be normal. The patient had no clinically evident sites of infection by history or physical examination. On day 2, a coryneform organism was recovered for 32 h by BACTEC (BD, Tokyo, Japan) from both the aerobic and anaerobic tubes of all blood cultures. Brevibacterium species were identified by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The score value was 2.36. On gram-stained smears from the culture plates, the organisms appeared as Gram-positive, club-shaped, slightly curved rods, and some coccal forms were present (Fig. a). The bacteria were subcultured on Trypticase Soy Agar II with 5% Sheep Blood (BD, Tokyo, Japan) at 35 °C in 5% CO2, which resulted in a gray-white, smooth, non-hemolytic colonies after a 48-incubation (Fig. b). Subsequently, genetic investigation by 16S ribosomal RNA analysis was performed in order to identify the organism. Finally, the result identified this pathogen as Brevibacterium paucivorans with 99.5% homology on the Ez taxon database ().
For comparison of a hydrolysis of casein in the organism, we obtained a type strain of B. casei, JCM 2594T and of B. paucivorans, JCM 11567T, from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms (JCM). Pyrazinamidase test was performed using PZA broth (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Casein hydrolysis test was performed as follows. 1) inoculate the organism on a skim milk agar, 2) incubate the plate at 37 °C, 3) examine the plate for zone of hydrolysis following incubation. Both the organism and JCM 11567T showed a lack of hydrolysis of casein, while a hydrolysis of casein was confirmed in JCM 2594T as shown in Fig. . The organism had an absence of pyrazinamidase, while JCM 2594T showed a presence of pyrazinamidase. Additional microbiological tests by API 50CH showed that utilization of D-arabinose and gluconate was negative. These results were consistent with the organism as B. paucivorans. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that the organism was susceptible to MEPM. Although the peripheral venous catheter site showed no erythema or tenderness, the catheter was removed without culture, and a follow-up blood culture remained negative after therapy lasting for 7 days. The patient’s fever finally abated and labs were also improved. On day 14, the antibiotic therapy was discontinued. On day 28 from admission, fever recurred and blood cultures were performed. Candida parapsilosis was isolated by 2 sets of blood cultures, and she was diagnosed as having candidemia. While L-AMB was started for Candida parapsilosis bacteremia, she died by candidemia on day 35.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for the strain using the broth microdilution method (Dry Plate®, Eiken Chemical co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines []. The isolate was susceptible to gentamicin [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 1 μg/ml], ciplofloxacin (MIC = 0.25 μg/ml), vancomycin (MIC≦0.5 μg/ml), meropenem (MIC≦0.5 μg/ml) and rifampicin (MIC≦0.12 μg/ml), and was resistant to clindamycin (MIC> 4 μg/ml), and was intermediately resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC = 2 μg/ml),and cefepim (MIC = 2 μg/ml) as shown in Table .

Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

 Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old woman was referred for colonoscopy because of abdominal pain and hematochezia. She had a history of end-stage renal disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. She underwent hemodialysis three times per week. The patient's hemodynamic parameters were stable. On physical examination, she was found to have right abdominal pain and tenderness. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13,900/mm2, a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, and a platelet count of 228,000/mm2. Serum biochemistry showed creatinine level, 6.6 mg/dL; albumin level, 3.0 g/dL; alanine aminotransferase level, 36 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase level, 38 IU/L; bilirubin level, 1.2 mg/dL; and alkaline phosphatase level, 198 IU/L with normal electrolytes. Serum was negative for antinuclear antibody and HIV antibody. Anemia was associated with chronic renal failure. On stool examination, negative results were obtained for stool WBC, stool culture, and Clostridium difficile toxin A/B. The electrocardiogram showed normal results. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed no evidence of bleeding. Colonoscopy was performed after standard bowel preparation and under sedation with 3 mg of midazolam. The colonoscopic findings showed diffuse bowel wall edema. Upon examination of the distal transverse colon, we found several deep linear red mucosal breaks resembling scratches ().
In the ascending colon, dark purple edematous mucosa and necrotic epithelial lesions were found (). Cecal intubation was not performed because of severe ischemic changes with necrosis. The remaining colorectal mucosa was grossly normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed moderate-to-severe diffuse bowel wall thickening and focally decreased mucosal enhancement in the right colon. The patient was diagnosed with ischemic colitis based on colonoscopic and CT findings, and clinical manifestations. The patient thus received supportive care. Intravenous fluids were administered to treat dehydration, and total parenteral nutrition with prophylactic antibiotics was provided. The patient was placed on bowel rest until the symptoms resolved. After 3 weeks, follow-up colonoscopy and CT were performed. On follow-up colonoscopy, the previous severe ischemic colonoscopic findings had disappeared, and ischemic mucosal change showed further resolution (). No further mucosal tearing was observed during the follow-up colonoscopy. On CT scans, improvement in ischemic colitis was noted. The patient no longer complained of abdominal pain or hematochezia.

Here is the task:
Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

 Here is the patient note:
This case was of a 67-year-old male patient who presented with upper abdominal pain and obstructive jaundice. Laboratory examination on admission showed serum total bilirubin level of 9.6 mg/dl. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging revealed Bismuth-Corlette type IIIB perihilar cholangiocarcinoma with left portal vein and left hepatic artery invasion, type III portal vein variation, dilated right intrahepatic bile duct, and left liver lobe atrophy (). Due to the unique location of the gallbladder and combined multiple hepatic anomalies, presence of LSGB was highly suspected (). The branching pattern of the portal vein appeared strange compared with the usual type III portal vein variation, in which the liver appeared to be divided into 3 parts; the right posterior section, the right anterior section integrated with the left medial section, and the left lateral section (). For biliary decompression, endoscopic nasobiliary drainage was performed following endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Surgery was performed when the serum total bilirubin level was 1.7 mg/dl.
After dissection of the hilar structures, we recognized that the tumor was located at the imaginary hilar bile duct bifurcation, but its actual location was corresponding to the biliary confluence of the left median and lateral sections. After transecting the distal bile duct at the level of the pancreas, we found that there was no vascular invasion of the right-sided liver. Thus, the extent of liver resection included extended left lateral sectionectomy (, ). Through the anterior transection approach without the hanging maneuver, the liver was transected and the bile duct was resected en bloc. The right-sided bile duct orifice in the liver was 8 mm in size and single, and probing exploration revealed that it was the common-channel bile duct confluence of the above-mentioned three sections in the right-sided liver. The resection margin was tumor-negative on frozen-section biopsy. Since only the left-sided wall of the umbilical portion of the portal vein was partially invaded by the tumor, the involved portion was excised and then covered with a remnant branch patch after excision of a small adjacent portal vein branch in the left medial section ().
The caudate duct did not appear to be involved based on the preoperative imaging study findings, but the Spigelian lobe with the paracaval portion was excised to achieve maximal curability according to the general concept of surgical resection for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. One 5-mm-sized bile duct opening was exposed following caudate lobe resection, but it was directly communicating with the right-sided duct; therefore, it was closed because bilio-enteric reconstruction was not necessary. Locoregional lymph nodes were dissected from the hepatic hilum to the celiac axis because some nodes were tumor-positive on frozen-section biopsy. Biliary reconstruction was performed through a single, large hepaticojejunostomy using a Roux-en-Y limb.
Pathological examination revealed that the final diagnosis was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the liver with vascular invasion of the left hepatic artery and left portal vein, concurrent perineural invasion without lymphovascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis in 5 out of 12 nodes (). Thus, tumor staging was T3N1M0, being stage IIIB according the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.
The patient recovered uneventfully without any complication and was discharged 11 days after surgery. Currently, the patient is receiving concurrent chemoradiation therapy.

 Here is the patient note:
A 40-year-old para four obese Caucasian woman with two-year history of lower abdominal pain was referred from a peripheral hospital for the further management of bilateral adnexal masses. The computerised tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed a complex cystic lesion of 7–8 cm in the right adnexum and bilateral ureteric obstruction. All baseline blood tests including haematology and tumour markers (CA 125 -26 IU/ml) were normal. The serum tests showed normal liver function and moderately impaired renal function (creatinine 10–15, urea > 200).
She had a complex medical history including obstructive sleep apnoea, asthma, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, hypertensive cardiomyopathy and bipolar disorder; registered disabled. She also had a copper intra uterine contraceptive device in situ for the past three years. Given her body habitus (BMI 42), abdominal and pelvic examination was difficult and non-specific. The only finding of relevance was bilateral adnexal fullness.
She was managed within the gynaecological oncology multi disciplinary framework (MDT). On reviewing the CT films the features noted include bilateral basal pleural thickening, bilateral hydronephrosis, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis and bilateral adnexal cystic masses. There was a small volume of ascites.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for further characterisation of the adnexal masses. The right adnexal complex cystic lesion measured 8 × 7 × 7 cm in diameter and had a thick wall (up to 2 cm), which was irregular. There were several septations, some of which measured 3 – 4 mm. There were no enhancing papillary formations, although the wall and septa enhanced. The appearance suggested an ovarian lesion with possible involvement of the Fallopian tube. The left adnexal cyst measured 5 × 6 × 4 cm, had a smooth wall and contained a single thin septation, consistent with a benign ovarian cyst. Both cysts contained fluid, which was low on T1 and high on T2, with no evidence of fat or blood. Surrounding the cysts posteriorly, the fat was streaky in appearance and there was marked thickening of the adjacent fascial planes, with thickening of the mesorectal fascia up to 1 cm. The fascial thickening extended up the pre-sacral space and along the posterior aspect of the pelvic sidewalls, resulting in the obstruction of the ureters. Enlarged lymph nodes (up to 1.8 cm in short axis) were present along both pelvic sidewalls, which were striking due to the very high T2 signal intensity (Figure ). Nodes were also seen in the inguinal and para-aortic regions. Although the imaging appearances could not rule out an ovarian neoplasm, the features noted above were suggestive of an inflammatory process. In view of the woman's medical history and clinical status the MDT recommendation was clinical review and imaging guided biopsy of lymph nodes.
The woman underwent CT guided right inter iliac node biopsy, following an unyielding biopsy of inguinal nodes. Histology revealed non-caseating granulomatous lymphadenitis with negative stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi. There was no foreign body seen. Given the histological findings our attention was directed towards an inflammatory process. She was subsequently referred to respiratory physicians, with a working diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She was also referred to urologists for the management of retroperitoneal fibrosis and bilateral hydronephrosis. Abdominal pain prompted insertion of bilateral JJ ureteric stents. The physicians initiated a (step-down) course of prednisolone. Symptomatic improvement was observed but the renal function did not change. Repeat imaging demonstrated resolution of hydronephrosis.
The woman was reviewed again clinically after the course of steroids. During this interval the physicians ordered an autoantibody screen as autoimmune disease can co-exist with sarcoidosis; the screen was negative (Rheumatoid factor, anti-DNA antibody and antinuclear antibody). On examination there was no evidence of any palpable lymphadenopathy. An ultra sonographic examination six months later demonstrated a bulky uterus and reduction in the size of the right adnexal cyst. Repeat imaging (MRI axial T2W image) a further two months later demonstrated resolution of the left adnexal cyst. There was a small residual cyst on the right and marked decrease in the thickening of the mesorectal fascia. The lymph nodes appeared normal (Fig ). The retroperitoneal fibrosis on imaging had resolved. Her CA125 remained normal. Currently the patient is under joint care between the respiratory and renal physicians with symptomatic improvement.

Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

 Here is the patient note:
The second case (Case B), a 22-year-old female, was Case A's roommate. She too had an extensive history of intravenous drug use. She was admitted to the hospital a month before Case A with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and renal failure of unclear etiology. Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, platelet count of 129 K/uL, BUN 137 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of 12.9 mg/dL. A peripheral blood smear revealed schistocytes and thrombocytopenia. LDH was 2027 U/L, and haptoglobin was <10 mg/dL. A presumptive diagnosis of TTP was made. ADAMTS-13 levels were drawn, and plasma exchange was initiated. She was positive for hepatitis C antibody, and HCV quantitative RNA was 2056 IU/mL. She was not on any therapy for hepatitis C. Other autoimmune and infectious workups were unremarkable. Due to rapidly declining renal function, a renal biopsy was obtained. The biopsy showed evidence of a thrombotic microangiopathic process (). Plasmapheresis was discontinued when ADAMTS-13 levels obtained at admission returned at 33%. With intensive care and supportive measures, her hematologic profile improved. However, she remained dialysis dependent. Based on her clinical picture she was thought to have atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and plans were made to start eculizumab. The true cause of her condition remained unclear until her friend (Case A) was admitted with similar issues. At this time, she too admitted to abusing Opana ER intravenously, which was confirmed by a positive urine test. With intensive care and supportive measures, her hematologic profile improved. However, she remained dialysis dependent.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old male was admitted with a 1-week history of fever and treated for urinary tract infection. His creatinine level upon presentation was 16.4 mg/dL. His past medical history included stroke and end-stage renal disease, for which he was on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for the past 2 years. He was started on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone 1 g daily for 3 days and subsequently escalated to IV cefepime 1 g bd (non-CAPD dose) as fever remained unsettled. Fever resolved with day 2 of cefepime, and he felt better in general. On day 3 of cefepime, he was found to be less responsive and confused. In total, he had received 5 g of cefepime before he became neurotoxic.
He did not obey commands and had no verbal output on examination. His vital signs were stable with no fever. He had myoclonic jerks. His pupils were bilaterally equal and reactive. He had no neck stiffness or long-tract signs. Apart from stable anemia, repeated full blood count did not show any leukocytosis. C-reactive protein level was not elevated. There were no electrolyte imbalances. Renal function profile was static. Urgent brain computed tomography showed no new infarcts or hemorrhage. Lumbar puncture was performed with an opening pressure of 15 cm H2O. The cerebrospinal fluid count and biochemistry were within normal limits. His electroencephalography (EEG) [] showed background slow activity with generalized triphasic waves. Cefepime was identified as the culprit of confusion and immediately stopped.

On day 7 of admission, he became drowsier with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9/15 with E2, V2, and M5, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer observation. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed no significant abnormalities apart from his old infarcts.
CAPD was converted to hemodialysis on admission to ICU. Postdialysis, he became more alert and responsive. In subsequent days, his GCS returned to full. A repeated EEG [] on day 8 of illness showed theta activity with resolution of triphasic waves. He was subsequently transferred back to the general ward and resumed with CAPD. He remained well upon clinic review.

 Here is the patient note:
A 62-year-old female was admitted for dyspnea. Her only medical history was cutaneous lupus treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate for 8 years. Physical examination found dyspnea, edema limited to the lower extremities and superior vena cava syndrome. Laboratory tests confirmed hypoxemia with PaO2 at 70 mmHg; and normal renal function (creatinine: 0.97 mg/dL). A computed tomography (CT) scan found normal pulmonary parenchyma and vascularization, but revealed the presence of an anterior mediastinal mass. A PET scan confirmed positive metabolic activity of the mediastinal mass (Fig. A). A biopsy was performed under mediastinoscopy. Pathological examination of the mass revealed the presence of pseudo-epithelial tumor cells of the thymus, while the thymic cortex was normal, without lymphocyte infiltration in the tumor tissue. These features led to a diagnosis of type A non-invasive thymoma (Fig. B).
While investigations on the mediastinal mass were being performed, the patient developed acute kidney injury (Creatinine 4.7 mg/dL), with nephrotic syndrome: serum albumin was 9.7 g/L, proteinuria was 17 g/g (composed of more than 80% of albumin) and microscopic hematuria was positive. In agreement with the nephrotic syndrome, a high level of cholesterol (total cholesterol = 3.07 g/l triglycerides = 1.19 g/l, LDL = 2.13 g/l), and lower levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG 2.58 g/l, IgA 1.73 g/l, IgM 2.5 g/l) were also found. Results of the renal biopsy were as follows: normal kidney parenchyma on optical microscopy and immuno-fluorescence analysis without any proliferation or deposition. Electronic microscopy showed extensive foot process effacement corresponding to a loss of cell differentiation, loss of pedicels and increased collagen matrix production, creating a gap between the podocyte and glomerular basement membrane (Fig. D). No podocyte detachment was observed and there was no evidence in favour of a diagnosis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Regarding immunologic tests, anti-nucleic antibodies were positive (1/160), but Extractable Nuclear Antigen (ENA) antibodies, complement fractions C3/C4, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Similarly, tests for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and cryoprotein were all negative. Our final diagnosis was minimal change disease (MCD) associated with thymoma. Therefore, oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) was initiated immediately and thymectomy was performed.
Eight weeks after initiation of the steroid therapy, the patient showed a significant lack of response to steroid therapy, with serum albumin of 10 g/L, and proteinuria of 13.5 g/g, Clinical examination found exacerbation of asthenia as well as edema. Given the intensity and the persistence of nephrotic syndrome, with no improvement after steroid induction, we decided to reinforce the treatment with rituximab (1 g given twice, 15 days apart). We monitored the CD19 count (96/mm3 before administration and 0/mm3 after the second dose - this is in agreement with the profound lymphocyte depletion expected). Over the following days, we noticed a progressive improvement in both albuminemia and proteinuria. Complete remission was observed 3 weeks after infusion of rituximab. We followed French guidelines for tapering off the corticosteroids. After 11 weeks at high dose (1 mg/kg/day = 80 mg/d from 09/06/19 to 22/08/19), we pursued with 50 mg/d for 2 weeks, 35 mg/d for 2 weeks, 25 mg/d for 2 weeks, 20 mg/d for 2 weeks, 17.5 mg/d for 2 weeks, 15 mg/d for 2 weeks, 10 mg/d for 2 weeks, 7.5 mg/d for 4 weeks, 5 mg/d for 4 weeks, followed by steroid withdrawal using hydrocortisone. At the last follow-up, serum albumin was 38 g/L, proteinuria was 0.6 g/g and creatinine 0.83 mg/dL (Fig. A). The patient consented to collection of serum at different timepoints. We performed a cytokine profile using a bead assay (Legendplex human inflammation panel, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) on serum collected before (BM1, BM2 and BM3) and after treatment with rituximab (BM4). We did not find any deregulation of the cytokine profile before treatment with rituximab, either on the TH1 side (INFg, TNF, IL6, IL12) or the TH2 side (IL4, IL5, IL10, IL13). Cytokines were in the normal range, except for MCP1 and IL18, which were increased. Interestingly, no modification was found on the serum collected after treatment with rituximab, suggesting that the beneficial effect of this treatment was not mediated by a modification of the cytokine balance (Fig. B and C).

The creatinine concentration is mg/dL.\nPlugging in these values will give us: 175 * 0.83^(-1.154) * 62^(-0.203) * 1 * 0.742=69.658.\nHence, the patient's GFR is 69.658 mL/min/1.73m².", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Timestamp': '2025-06-17T01:28:07.559713', 'Unique_Identifier': 'calc_9_note_pmc-8425126-1_row_150', 'Attention_Analysis_Directory': 'attention_results/calc_9_note_pmc-8425126-1_row_150', 'Attention_Files_Generated': ['essential_data']}
